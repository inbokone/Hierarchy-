1
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,961
HIERARCHY

2
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,647
You're crazy.
Everyone here is crazy.

3
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,109
You're crazy.

4
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,153
You're all crazy!

5
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,863
I'm going to expose it all!

6
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,495
You're all crazy!

7
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,794
The teachers, the students,

8
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,963
the entire school
are all completely deranged!

9
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,965
I don't care! I have to--

10
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,385
I'm… I'm gonna expose everything
that's going on here!

11
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:05,750
EPISODE 1
NEWBIE PARTY: TRUTH OR DARE

12
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,483
The problem can
easily be solved once you graph

13
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,152
the absolute value of x…

14
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:39,909
The answer…

15
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,578
"I saw thee weep

16
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,621
The big bright tear

17
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,291
Came o'er that eye of blue

18
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,459
And then methought it did appear…"

19
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,331
FIRST SEMESTER OPENING CEREMONY

20
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,926
A new semester has begun
at the most prestigious school in Korea,

21
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:42,972
Jooshin High, where we take pride
in our time-honored traditions.

22
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,728
In the spirit of those traditions,

23
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:53,816
we're putting Jooshin's motto,
"noblesse oblige," into practice.

24
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,569
To celebrate this new semester,

25
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,863
let's welcome
our new scholarship recipient,

26
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,990
who was hand selected…

27
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,911
out of quite a few applicants.

28
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,624
Kang Ha. Come.

29
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,626
Yes, ma'am.

30
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:21,010
Scholarship students never last here.
Why admit them anymore?

31
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,513
Because they wanna give
the poor kids a chance too.

32
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,516
"Noblesse oblige," you know?
They can't forget that.

33
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,226
-Who? The principal?
-Check, check.

34
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,603
No, the school owners.

35
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,854
Ri-an's mom and dad.

36
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,564
Good morning,

37
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,151
students, seniors, and underclassmen.

38
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,196
My name is Kang Ha.

39
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,868
As the first to ace
the Jooshin High scholarship…

40
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,127
Hey.

41
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,103
As the first student to ace the test…

42
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,939
Check.

43
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,695
-Finally.
-You're late.

44
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,659
Please continue.

45
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,036
Uh, ah. Oh, it's working.

46
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,413
So, uh, where was I?

47
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,457
Um, the exam! Right.

48
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,750
I got the highest grade.

49
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,461
-He has such a cute smile.
-How I got here doesn't matter…

50
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,463
He's got this puppy dog energy, right?

51
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,882
…today transferring
to Korea's best private school…

52
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,508
…Jooshin High.

53
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,386
To honor that reputation,
I intend to focus on my studies

54
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,765
and keep getting good grades
so I can live up to your school's legacy.

55
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,725
I look forward to the year ahead.

56
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,941
JUST TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON

57
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,486
ANSWER THE PHONE, JAE-I
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

58
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,241
That concludes
our opening ceremonies.

59
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,870
Now, students, I'll ask you to begin
making your way to your classes, please.

60
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,499
-Whoa. Sit down.
-What? What?

61
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,583
Just sit down.

62
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,126
What's wrong?

63
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,046
That crazy fucking dumbass.

64
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,767
What've you been up to?
I was messaging Ye-ji the whole time.

65
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:37,939
Excuse me.

66
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,484
Hello. I was just up there.
I'm the new student.

67
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,320
I have English first period,
but I don't know where I'm going.

68
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,446
Could you help me?

69
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,323
You're too happy.

70
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,535
You need time to get to know your place.

71
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,494
Hmm?

72
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,455
Get to know my what?
You're leaving? Uh, all right.

73
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,589
You lost? They'll show you where to go.

74
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,092
Gimme your number.

75
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,927
What? For…

76
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,471
Well, I didn't expect that.

77
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,640
I figured you might want
someone to help you out.

78
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,183
Like, if you have any questions.

79
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,268
Ah. Right.

80
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,437
Thank you.

81
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,605
-What's your handle?
-We'll follow you back.

82
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,233
-I'm not on anything.
-No social media?

83
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,192
Mm-mm.

84
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,905
There you go.
I should get going. See you, guys.

85
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,242
Wow.

86
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,536
He is such a weirdo.

87
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,794
Wow.

88
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,629
What is this?

89
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,053
Yeah, not there.

90
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,267
Oh, hello.

91
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,604
The scholarship student?
You're not allowed in here.

92
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,355
This is English, isn't it?

93
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,399
At the end of the hall. Standard A.

94
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,692
This is Special A.

95
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,360
Ah, so not here.

96
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,240
-Hi.
-Fuckin' scholarship kid.

97
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,575
Why's he in here?

98
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,921
I'm so excited.
I can't wait to get tickets.

99
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,466
That's my seat.

100
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,468
Ah, okay.

101
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,345
Uh, sorry.

102
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,306
That's my friend's seat.

103
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,308
Oh, is it?

104
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,871
No bag hook?

105
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,742
Shaved off 1.25 seconds.

106
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,871
Ri-an, how about we grab lunch?

107
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,167
Any classes left?

108
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,006
I'm all done. You have one more, right?

109
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,259
At 4:00. Social studies.

110
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,854
Woo-jin's so weird lately.
He dating anyone?

111
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,150
And Jae-i? Still ghosting you?

112
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,378
If you two haven't made up
with each other,

113
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,631
then maybe I

114
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:36,636
should make a play for her king
while the queen is away.

115
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,847
How do I get that checkmate?

116
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,184
I worked out the whole break.

117
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,396
Take a good look. Did my work pay off?

118
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,859
I don't even need to look.

119
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,364
I'm well aware you've got a body
models would kill for.

120
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,240
So

121
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,660
stop messing around.

122
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,579
I wasn't though.

123
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,082
You didn't have to be
so direct about it. Damn.

124
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,585
Where you going?

125
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,920
I have plans.

126
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,589
Not fleeing from humiliation.

127
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,658
Jae-i!

128
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,220
What'd you do for three months
in America all alone?

129
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,974
I have cousins in Irvine,
so I had stuff to do.

130
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,727
Wow. I'm still pretty hurt.

131
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,647
Always sent me straight to voicemail.
I mean, you can do that to me and Woo-jin.

132
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,900
But don't tell me
you also did that to Ri-an?

133
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:20,406
Of course. I knew it. Something was up.
Now I know why he's been so moody lately.

134
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,324
You fight or something? What's wrong?

135
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,578
I mean, even if you did,
you'll always be inseparable.

136
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,663
How could you ghost him for that long?

137
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,832
I have something to say to everyone.

138
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,750
What is it?

139
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,253
I have plans in the morning, but let's do
Sunday afternoon at the track.

140
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,213
The racecourse?

141
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,513
Why there? And why does
she want me to assemble the troops?

142
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,441
Assemblyman Lee.
Over here. Let's take a group photo.

143
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,692
Say "kimchi."

144
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,444
-Kimchi!
-One, two, three.

145
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,446
-Kimchi!
-All right, we got it.

146
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,948
-Give yourselves a round of applause.
-Well done.

147
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,284
Bye.

148
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,830
Attention, everyone.
Are you all free Sunday afternoon?

149
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,624
It's been a while. Let's hang out.

150
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,792
Thank you!

151
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:17,797
Jooshin Electronics'
cell phone sales have been on the rise.

152
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,465
Especially in Barcelona.

153
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,050
I read that this morning.

154
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,761
What about France?

155
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,222
Jooshin bakery brand
will be launched--

156
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,223
Just a moment.

157
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,768
Our Jung Jae-i
has finally come back to us.

158
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,563
Let's meet at the track Sunday.
Don't be late, all right?

159
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,576
And this one?
What do you think?

160
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,245
It complements your complexion.

161
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,210
This one here.

162
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,218
OUR JUNG JAE-I HAS FINALLY COME BACK TO US
LET'S MEET AT THE TRACK SUNDAY

163
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,434
I certainly hope
the food is to your liking.

164
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,645
I don't often indulge
in such luxuries.

165
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,188
You spoil me, truly.

166
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,607
Sharing a beautiful meal
in a beautiful garden

167
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,651
and with you, above all people,
Chairman Jung.

168
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,777
Thank you.

169
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,197
Assemblyman Lee has mentioned
organizing a lunch several times,

170
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,783
but I was busy,
so I hope it was worth the wait.

171
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,911
Pardon me, but may I say
you have a beautiful daughter?

172
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,497
I bet she takes after her mother.

173
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,750
Oh, do you think so?

174
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,004
I appreciate it, but I think Jae-i is…

175
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,340
far, far prettier.

176
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,387
Blessed with both looks
and brains and excels in school.

177
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,139
You must be so proud.

178
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,976
Woo-jin told me that Jae-i is
at the top of her class at Jooshin High.

179
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,395
Well, we've been pretty lucky.

180
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,189
The children study hard
without us having to push them, really.

181
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,400
We're proud of our Jae-hyeok as well.

182
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,653
Graduated from Hanguk Middle,
top of his class last year.

183
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,406
I'm just glad to have graduated.

184
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,366
You graduated
from Hanguk Middle School?

185
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,743
That's my alma mater!

186
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,746
I didn't expect to meet
a fellow alumnus here. Wow!

187
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:22,838
Jae-i?

188
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,135
Are you not feeling well?

189
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,347
I noticed you weren't really eating much.

190
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,932
I'm fine, thank you.

191
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,435
Well, we'll be heading upstairs for tea.
Come up when you're ready.

192
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,312
All right. Be right up.

193
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,190
That outfit…

194
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,278
Did you pick out that dress?

195
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,909
You should go and get changed.

196
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,663
I just don't think it suits
an occasion like today's.

197
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,831
People are judging us
on the tiniest details.

198
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,584
Your style.
How tasteful your clothes are. Everything.

199
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,297
Try dressing more modestly, classier.
A bit, uh, a bit more like your mother.

200
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,968
And which mother are you referring to?

201
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,138
-Stepmother?
-We're not doing this again!

202
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,936
I mean my wife, and you know that.

203
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,729
The woman you were raised by.

204
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,107
Not the one who gave birth to you.

205
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,324
Anyway, I think you'd better
go change that outfit.

206
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,368
I'll go get changed.

207
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,329
And while we're at it…

208
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,422
you need to put on
a different shade of lipstick.

209
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,340
Look at that. The color, it's…

210
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,592
it's vulgar.

211
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,346
Just exactly like your birth mother.

212
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,351
You are my firstborn.

213
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,104
I hope you will start behaving

214
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,856
more like my child

215
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,608
and heir to the Jaeyul Group.

216
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,701
I'll see you upstairs.

217
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,177
JOOSHIN HIGH RECEIVES
MORE APPLICANTS IN 2024

218
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:50,838
I'm just, um,

219
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,173
working part-time.

220
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,300
A gig, playing piano.

221
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,683
I… was taking a short break,
but it's over now.

222
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,185
Gotta get back.

223
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,817
Do you need this? To wipe off your…

224
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,820
Yeah, no.

225
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,531
You can give me your shirt.

226
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,617
-What?
-Your shirt.

227
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,369
I need to borrow one.

228
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,121
My shirt?

229
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,749
I have to be somewhere,
but I can't go looking like this.

230
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,170
Oh. Right. Right.

231
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:36,133
It's just-- I couldn't just walk around
without a shirt on, you know?

232
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,344
Okay, wait.

233
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,361
Looks like…

234
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,823
you need this more than I do.

235
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,000
Jeez, it's cold.

236
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,105
Don't they get freaked out?
Why do they do this?

237
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,150
I don't get it either.

238
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,154
For the thrill. To feel alive.

239
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,783
Hey, Jae-i!

240
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,619
It's been forever.

241
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,373
-I really missed you.
-How are you?

242
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,126
Your outfit today is,
uh, a statement.

243
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,752
Hey, since it's been forever,
let's celebrate.

244
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,130
You know, let's go somewhere after this.
Let's have fun.

245
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,047
Hello, Jae-i.

246
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,467
You've really got nothing to say?

247
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,556
-He-ra.
-Yeah?

248
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,308
I'm gonna play a game with Ri-an.

249
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,978
A game? Like what?

250
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,604
The winner gets their wish granted.

251
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,190
What kind of wish?

252
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,234
You'll find out.

253
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,278
Three laps, I take the pole.

254
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,030
When I win, that's it.

255
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,781
Once you agree, no backing out.

256
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,033
You haven't won yet.

257
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,659
Now, if I win,

258
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,871
you'll have to start by explaining

259
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,457
what the hell is going on here.

260
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,622
What's gotten into those two?

261
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,293
-Why are they so extra?
-Uh, who knows.

262
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,482
♪ Wild ♪

263
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:50,071
♪ I'm wild ♪

264
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,703
♪ I'm wild… ♪

265
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:32,072
♪ Now I'm coming for you
Now I'm coming full attack ♪

266
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,449

267
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,119
♪ Now I'm coming full attack ♪

268
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,747

269
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,669

Now I'm coming full attack ♪

270
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:19,202
Hey, why were you driving like that?
You could have gotten hurt, Jae-i.

271
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,537
I won.

272
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,164
I won, so now…

273
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:25,750
now I'll…

274
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,712
tell you my wish.

275
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:32,966
We're finished.

276
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,551
I'm done.

277
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,611
He-ra.

278
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,237
-Yeah?
-Let's get going.

279
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,328
I don't get it. Did something happen
before she went to America?

280
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,914
I don't know. I have no idea.

281
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,376
I've never seen them act this way.

282
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,007
Say that again.

283
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,844
Let's break up. Let's end it.

284
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:19,763
But why?

285
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,475
I'm talking to you.
Why are you doing this?

286
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,937
You… you acted like a total stranger
before you left,

287
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,523
then you go radio silent
and disappear for three months?

288
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,859
And this is the first thing you say to me?

289
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,071
We were six years old when we met.

290
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,240
And then the summer we turned 15,

291
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,993
you said you liked me
from the moment you saw me.

292
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,163
Why?

293
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,124
What was your reasoning?

294
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,709
You don't have to have a reason when--

295
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:50,710
Exactly.

296
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,878
There was none.

297
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:57,175
There isn't a good reason
for why you like or dislike someone.

298
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,635
Hey!

299
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,554
Let's be friends.

300
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,057
Just be friends from now on.

301
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,894
I won the bet.

302
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,437
Keep your word.

303
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,231
Hey, Jae-i.

304
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,191
Come on, Jae-i!

305
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,564
He's killing it.

306
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,483
Really giving "sexy bad boy"
even more than usual.

307
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,403
Did you see the bandage
on his hand? Is he hurt?

308
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,366
Jae-i. Rooibos.

309
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,577
Oh, thank you.

310
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,787
Did you… get home all right?

311
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,291
I saw Ri-an got hurt.

312
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,209
-Did something happen after--
-He-ra.

313
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,545
Maybe later.

314
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,550
All right, then. Well, good chat.

315
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,451
We have no special announcements.

316
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,747
If anyone needs to change their classes,
you have until the end of the week.

317
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,125
Let's make this semester
an uneventful one, please.

318
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,961
And with that, good luck
with your classes today.

319
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,258
Class President, could you and I
have a word, please?

320
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,723
Hey, signing up for cello?
I'm playing flute.

321
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,226
Probably stick to cello.
No way I'd have time for both.

322
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,353
Sorry, I have a question for you.

323
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,730
Class changes. How do you apply?

324
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,232
What?

325
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,360
I heard there were classes like rowing
and fencing, but none on my schedule.

326
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,070
Why are you asking me that?

327
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,864
You should ask your little friends.

328
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,783
"Friends"?

329
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,123
-So, uh…
-What now?

330
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,084
Where do I go to change classes?

331
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,463
Here's the main event schedule
for the semester.

332
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,675
Ju-won.

333
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,052
Can you please
keep an eye on the new student?

334
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:50,223
You're our class president, so I'd like
to make sure his transition goes smoothly.

335
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,475
So what happened before

336
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,103
doesn't happen again.

337
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,023
Yes, ma'am.

338
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,868
Did you figure out what her problem was?

339
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,704
There was none.

340
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,539
There isn't a good reason

341
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,876
for why you like or dislike someone.

342
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,424
Let's backtrack.

343
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,926
I remember you had your falling out
around my birthday,

344
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,928
right before she ran to the States.

345
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,722
So you don't have any idea at all?

346
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,100
No idea what might've upset her?
Come on, think.

347
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,729
No idea.

348
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,607
Damn, man. Sounds like you should've
given up trying to figure it out.

349
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,985
You can spend years and never figure out
why a girl's mad at you. They're insane.

350
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,069
Hey!

351
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,907
You could apologize.
"I don't know what I did, but I'm wrong."

352
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,658
That's when she'll come clean.

353
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,119
"Actually, okay, this is why I was upset."

354
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,330
And even then, you won't get it.

355
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,919
Yun-seok's kinda got a point.

356
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,338
Go to her and say you're sorry.

357
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,340
Girls sometimes
put their men through tests.

358
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,717
What tests?

359
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,761
Just to see if you'll say sorry to her.

360
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,221
Apologize. Say you can't live without her.

361
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,140
Girls eat that up. Trust me.

362
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,059
Even Jae-i?

363
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,352
She's a girl, isn't she?

364
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,188
Tell you what. Let's have a party.

365
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,690
At the vacation home.
He can tell her there.

366
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,150
Ooh, that sounds like fun.

367
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,735
-Right?
-Yeah!

368
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,028
I wanna do magic.

369
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,739
Um, please tell me
he's not actually going to sit there.

370
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,451
You crazy bastard!

371
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:37,914
Move aside.

372
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:48,007
A little birdie told me you're having
a hard time learning your place here.

373
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,926
I am?

374
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:53,304
Ri-an hadn't even left the assembly yet,
and you just stood up.

375
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,723
You were snooping around
all the special classrooms.

376
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,517
Tried to sit wherever
you damn well pleased.

377
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,603
And today,
trying to sit on the stands, bro?

378
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,648
I did. That was wrong?

379
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,401
This guy's clueless, Chan-min.

380
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,112
For a kid who came here on scholarship,
he isn't very smart.

381
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:12,365
He even asked Ye-ji
about how to change classes earlier.

382
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,367
The Jooshin Mart owner's kid.

383
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,040
So what's wrong?
What's wrong with the classes you're in?

384
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:24,252
I just-- I would rather
do fencing and rowing.

385
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,671
Fencing and rowing?

386
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,923
There were no classes
like that at my old school.

387
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,800
But this school's cool. They even have--

388
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,385
Go to the staff room for that.

389
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,889
But can you… even afford
the special class fees?

390
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,517
Rowing's around 40 million won a pop.

391
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,352
Fencing's a little bit cheaper.

392
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,854
Forty million?

393
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,897
Oh! Pretty pricey!

394
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,065
Jeez.

395
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,530
All right, newbie. Listen carefully.

396
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,492
This school isn't like
any other school you've been to

397
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,078
'cause Jooshin's rules are different.

398
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,204
The rule?

399
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,707
Never piss off the wrong people.

400
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,584
And who are they?

401
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:08,087
Jae-i, Hera, Woo-jin,
and especially Ri-an.

402
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,172
They're the royalty.

403
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,715
Why are they royalty?

404
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,092
What do you mean, "why"?
It's obvious.

405
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,345
They're not like us, all right!
We're scholarship kids.

406
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:20,099
They give us different colored ties
based on our status to set us apart.

407
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,601
Scholarship kids get navy.

408
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,352
The others get maroon.

409
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,522
Ri-an's great-grandfather
founded the school.

410
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:30,443
His grandfather and his descendants
all went to this school, so he's a given

411
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,362
because he was born into a family
who contributed to the school.

412
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:36,741
We're only able to study here
thanks to their generosity.

413
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,119
So it's only right we treat him
with respect, don't you think?

414
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,915
"Respect."

415
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,416
Dude, come on!

416
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,919
It's not that hard.
Just get it through your thick skull!

417
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,670
Don't snoop where you don't belong.

418
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,173
And do your best to stay out of their way.

419
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,051
-Why is that so hard to grasp?
-No. It's just…

420
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,845
Respect. I got that.

421
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,057
But putting them on a pedestal,
treating them like royalty?

422
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,143
You don't think that
might be a little extreme?

423
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,354
You can call it
whatever the fuck you want!

424
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,981
Think I'm overreacting, do you?

425
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,441
You should be as well.

426
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,282
Do you know why you're even here?

427
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,831
There was an opening
for a scholarship student.

428
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,167
Why was there a spot open?

429
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,087
Here's why!

430
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,466
The kid ignored my warnings
and stepped out of line…

431
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,515
and was killed by Ri-an.

432
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,912
Uh…

433
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,667
I think I understand what you're saying.

434
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,504
I should, uh, try to get along with them

435
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,298
if I want my school life
to be a lot easier.

436
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,969
I'll keep that in mind. Thank you.

437
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,226
You think he got the message?

438
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,645
Why is that moron still smiling?

439
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,946
I've been here a few days
but never got to say hi.

440
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,618
You guys remember me?

441
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,077
Kang Ha.

442
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,747
Nice to meet you, Kim Ri-an.

443
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,718
Oh my God.

444
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,261
You're slacking off, buddy!

445
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,348
-Come get your boy.
-Sorry, Yun-seok.

446
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,141
You prick.

447
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,602
Oh my God! You pranked him, didn't you?

448
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,853
Oh, not a prank.

449
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,314
What did they tell you?
We're evil rich kids?

450
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,775
So suck up to us
so we don't eat you alive, right?

451
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,235
Hmm?

452
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,696
Well, they were wrong.
They were pranking you.

453
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,035
Yeah, we really should've had your party
before you got hazed.

454
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,370
You're coming, right?

455
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,373
It's gonna be your welcome party, okay?

456
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:31,832
Welcome party?

457
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,669
See you tomorrow. I'll send you a ride.

458
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:37,296
See you.

459
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,924
Better be there. We'll be waiting.

460
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,952
That should do it.

461
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,620
She'll like this? Are you sure?

462
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,414
Jae-i will?

463
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,082
Pretty sure.

464
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,459
I'll see if she's on her way.

465
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,589
This is totally not her style.

466
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,783
Jae-i, girl. I'm serious.

467
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,994
I won't start the party
until you get here.

468
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,747
So hurry up!

469
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,697
Uh, no electronics past this point.

470
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,657
Your cell phone and other devices

471
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,618
will be stored
and returned when you leave.

472
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,828
Ah. Sure.

Dude! I can't believe
you actually showed up!

479
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,642
Go on.

480
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,936

All right. What do you say
we get this party started?

505
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,809
How about a welcome shot?

506
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,436
Welcome shots coming up.

507
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,231
A time-honored tradition.

508
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:27,067
We do it with scholarship kids.
Like a lucky draw.

How so?

510
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,154
Five of these shots
are regular alcohol,

511
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:33,282
but one is something very special.

512
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,409
Whoa!

513
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,077
"Something special"?

514
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,038
You'll know it if you drink it.

515
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,248
-All right, then. I'll start.
-All right!

516
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,005
Ooh!

517
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,182
Regular booze.

518
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,106
I don't drink alcohol.

519
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,863
Drink the shot.

520
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,823
Drink the shot.

521
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,534
Drink the shot.

522
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,910
Drink the shot!

523
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:21,205
Drink the shot!
Drink the shot! Drink the shot!

524
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:25,292
We went through all this trouble for you.
You can at least try it.

525
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,924
-Pick a shot!
-You do it!

526
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,844
-Come on.
-Pick one, pick one, pick one.

527
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,057
Okay!

528
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,907
Yeah!

529
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,291
Yeah!

530
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,836
Let's get this party started!

531
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,219
Whoo!

532
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,138
It's the weekend!

533
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,608
The next magic trick
will be tissue magic!

534
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,987
Eat the tissues.

535
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,989
Yeah, suck it down.

536
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,953
It keeps coming out!

537
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,176
Now, begone!

538
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,637
-Magic show's over!
-The show is over!

539
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,680
All right, let's make a bet.

540
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:05,267
Between you and Chan-min, who can walk
in a straight line without tripping?

541
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,478
Loser pays 500,000 won.

542
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:08,646
All right!

543
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,647
Go!

544
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,276
Stop breaking things!

545
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,612
Do you know
how much all of this costs, asshole?

546
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:20,616
Oh no. Jesus. He's screwed.

547
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,660
Dude, you better call your mom.
Not playing.

548
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:26,163
This is fucking serious.
You better get your parents on the phone.

549
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,667
-Hey! Come on!
-Ew!

550
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,445
Spin the wheel!

551
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,073
Spin it!

552
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,157
Spin it!

553
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,413
It's Ba-da!

554
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,707
Okay, you're it, Ba-da. You're up.

555
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,917
Your question is…

556
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:15,462
When was the last time you did it?
Truth or dare?

557
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,924
Truth. Mmm, nope, dare.

558
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,427
-Oh, come on. Don't chicken out.
-Whoa!

559
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,886
Tell us anyway.

560
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,806
Okay, spill. Was it, like, this morning?

561
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,266
-No way.
-Forget it.

562
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,143
I'll just take the damn shot.

563
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,769
Girl, seriously?

564
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,481
-I'll take it.
-Aw!

565
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,900
-Look at this guy.
-You're so sweet!

566
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,945
Look at that.
Chivalry is not dead.

567
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,243
You're finally back, Jung Jae-i.

568
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,632
Do you remember?
October 27th last year.

569
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,426
I was surprised.

570
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:05,345
Do you think your dad
would like this video too?

571
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,059
Let's talk.

572
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,899
Okay, okay. One more round.

573
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,067
-Last time, I promise!
-Better make it count.

574
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,903
Spin it!

575
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,739
Come on. Come on, come on.

576
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:07,908
I know

577
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,994
it isn't your style.

578
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,454
But I…

579
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,250
I mean, I thought I had to do something.

580
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,088
I'm sorry.

581
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,424
For what?

582
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,509
Whatever I did.

583
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,011
I'm sorry for everything.

584
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,721
I don't need an apology.

585
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,224
But

586
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,768
I do need you to accept that

587
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,395
it's over.

588
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,771
And I won't tell you why.

589
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,107
Till the day I die.

590
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,568
Are you hearing yourself
right now?

591
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,320
Just tell me what the hell is going on!

592
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,740
You have to give me a reason, or else--
No, I can't just accept it.

593
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,879
Come on, come on, come on!

594
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,132
It's Kang Ha!

595
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,758
-Oh!
-Scholarship kid!

596
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:07,759
Your turn, newbie.

597
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:12,431
All right, is there a girl here
you'd wanna sleep with tonight?

598
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,270
Choose wisely.
Depending on who you pick,

599
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,521
she might let you.

600
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,192
-Truth.
-Truth.

601
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,444
Hmm.

602
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,414
No. Dare.

603
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,625
All right, dare.

604
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:44,546
Hmm. Kiss one of us girls with tongue
for three whole minutes.

605
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,257
Oh! French kiss? French kiss!

606
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,343
French kiss! French kiss!

607
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,054
-French kiss! French kiss!
-Hey.

608
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,556
Ooh!

609
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,517
-Oh, I thought he was angry.
-Oh my gosh.

610
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,686
-Oh!
-Dude.

611
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,001
Where… where you going?

612
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,295
Oh, that fucker
already had a girl in mind!

613
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,381
-Come on, let's go!
-Wait for us!

614
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,465
Follow him!

615
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,142
I hope you haven't forgotten
the promise I made you,

616
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:40,852
In-han.

617
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,359
In-Han.

618
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,826
I said I'll do whatever it takes

619
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,121
to find whoever did that to you.

620
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,251
K… K… Kang

621
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,462
K… K…

622
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,888
The bastard who killed you.

623
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,351
Why was there a spot open?

624
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:25,188
The kid ignored my warnings
and stepped out of line

625
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,691
and was killed by Ri-an.

626
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,574
Why are you here?

627
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,576
To expose everything.

628
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,245
Everything that asshole did to you.

629
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,164
What the hell do you want?

630
00:50:58,805 --> 00:50:59,973
I'll expose it…

631
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:01,892
no matter what.
