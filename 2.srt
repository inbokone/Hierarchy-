1
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,961
HIERARCHY

2
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,237
Mmm.

3
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,247
Good morning. You sleep all right?

4
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,084
Mm-mm.

5
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,384
Time to wake up.

6
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,303
Mm-mm.

7
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,478
Did you sleep all right?

8
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,188
Mmm.

9
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,537
Don't be late, okay?

10
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,043
-I'll see you at school.
-See ya!

11
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,651
EPISODE 2
SECRET: WITHIN A SECRET

12
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,454
We're finished.

13
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,664
I'm done.

14
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,098
I trust you've all been well.
Hand out their gifts.

15
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,146
We're very grateful, ma'am.

16
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,984
I didn't think
I'd see you until next month.

17
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,196
Ri-an, my dear son.

18
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,948
You're looking well.

19
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,617
My business in Singapore ended early,
so I thought I'd visit.

20
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,995
How's school? A third-year already!

21
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:51,332
My, how time flies.
You'll be in college before we know it.

22
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,127
A mother gets emotional.

23
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,837
They grow up so fast.

24
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,797
I'm a second-year.

25
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,465
Hmm?

26
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,592
I still have a year before I graduate.

27
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,806
That's wonderful! Have you thought about
what university you'd like to attend?

28
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,684
Perhaps… England would be a good fit?

29
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,685
Oh.

30
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,021
Let's get my schedule in order.

31
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,188
Yes, ma'am.

32
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,572
Lunch with the executives at 12:00.

33
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,449
Jooshin Gallery at 2:00.

34
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,658
Jooshin Hotel at 4:00.

35
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,036
And… what else was there?

36
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,746
You have a meeting with Director An.

37
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,874
-I'll squeeze the director in after lunch.
-Right.

38
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,585
Everything in London
is marvelous, except the weather.

39
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,588
Choose somewhere in the UK.
You won't regret it.

40
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,173
You've been gone three months.

41
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,216
We haven't had a real conversation
in over a year.

42
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,178
You could at least ask me how I'm doing.

43
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,097
Like, if I'm eating all right,
or if I've been sick!

44
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,390
I'm not a grown-up.

45
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,643
I still need my parents sometimes.

46
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,897
How many staff members
have I assigned to take care of Ri-an?

47
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,273
Six tutors, two assistants,

48
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,233
three health specialists,
and four nutritionists.

49
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,443
Fifteen total, ma'am.

50
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,321
What kind of attention are you lacking?

51
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,583
And let's set something up with CEO Ryu
before the board meeting.

52
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,751
Yes, ma'am.

53
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,115
Oh! Tae-ho!

54
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,450
Hey!

55
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,705
Jesus Christ.

56
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,874
Get your dirty hands off me,
you charity case!

57
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,546
Hey, Tae-ho.

58
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,094
Man,
you really don't have a clue, do you?

59
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,596
-Do you know Tae-ho?
-Of course he doesn't.

60
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,433
Does he look like he's friends
with the heir to Jaeyul Hotels?

61
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,394
Look, scholarship kid,
going here doesn't make you our friend.

62
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,313
He laughed!

63
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,648
-Wow!
-In our faces!

64
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,444
This commoner thinks he can just come up
and touch the nobles whenever he wants.

65
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,405
Tae-ho should wash
his shoulder. It might start rotting off.

66
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,157
Ooh, look.

67
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,241
Ooh!

68
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,993
No way!
He actually showed his face?

69
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,662
Ri-an's gonna make
an unboxing video with his guts.

70
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:38,332
He's got nerve, that's for sure.
Seriously, what was going on that night?

71
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,210
How could Jae-i just stand there
and let that scholarship kid kiss her?

72
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,420
Maybe she was into it.

73
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,089
Ugh, no way!
Jae-i with a scholarship kid?

74
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,341
She would never! Would she, He-ra?

75
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,220
I wouldn't rule it out.

76
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,765
Scholarship or not,
if Jae-i likes him, that's that.

77
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,933
Actually, it's inspiring.

78
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,979
To be attracted to someone without regard
to their status or social class.

79
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:00,980
Really?

80
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,816
So what about you, He-ra?
Does that rule apply to you?

81
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,984
Oh, I'm different.

82
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,070
I could never be attracted to a man
that much poorer than I am.

83
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,364
It's just in my DNA.

84
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,408
Oh. Hey, he's coming.

85
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,647
You don't wanna get
on their bad side.

86
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,857
Everything Chan-min said
the other day is true.

87
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,942
The kid who died,

88
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,069
it was because he pissed off Ri-an.

89
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,238
They said it was a hit-and-run,
but that's bullshit.

90
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,282
He was so scared of Ri-an's goons,
he ran into traffic.

91
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,202
Or somebody hit him on purpose.

92
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,122
But why?
What did he do to piss off Ri-an?

93
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,166
It was because of Jae-i.

94
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,502
He was friends with Jae-i,
and Ri-an didn't like it.

95
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,630
-What? You mean, that's all?
-"That's all"? Jae-i's his girlfriend!

96
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,175
His Achilles heel.
She's the only thing he cares about!

97
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,460
Tell me something.

98
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,296
Was that little show really necessary?

99
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,630
What do you mean, "show"?

100
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,382
The kiss?

101
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,596
What I said earlier
should have been enough.

102
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,681
I've been perfectly clear to you.

103
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,684
Who I like
and what I choose to do with them

104
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,644
has nothing to do with you.

105
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,812
You like that guy?

106
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,772
The scholarship kid?

107
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,192
What's really going on here?

108
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,279
What's the real reason
you're calling it off all of a sudden?

109
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,990
And why are you
bringing the new kid into it?

110
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,952
You said you'd die
before you told me the truth,

111
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,621
but I need to know, Jung Jae-i.

112
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,372
Matter of fact,

113
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,667
I'm not letting you get away
without an explanation.

114
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:31,631
I can promise you right now
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

115
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,094
Whatever it takes to find out
the secret you're keeping from me.

116
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,680
And I won't stop
until you're back were you belong.

117
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,493
I'll take care of that prick. Quietly.

118
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,036
No, not quietly.

119
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,537
I want everybody to know.

120
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,083
He needs to learn
that there are consequences

121
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,335
for putting his hands on what's mine.

122
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,629
Don't you think
we should lay low for a little while

123
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,047
when that other kid just died?

124
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,843
Okay, I'll take care of it.

125
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,470
He'll get the message.

126
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,767
From this moment on,

127
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,895
any asshole that speaks
to the new scholarship student,

128
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,355
or even acknowledges him,

129
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,941
will get the same treatment.

130
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,943
Chan-min.

131
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,114
I shouldn't have to tell you
how to handle this stuff.

132
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,658
I mean, do I have to
hold your fucking hand through everything?

133
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,702
You're right.
It won't happen again.

134
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,787
I was actually
just in the middle of a plan.

135
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,455
A plan to take care of him!

136
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,548
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,009
I've never seen anyone make these plans
in front of their target.

138
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,638
-Have you?
-Do you have a death wish, motherfucker?

139
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,018
Hey, Yun-seok just told you
not to speak to me.

140
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,353
Or did you not hear him?

141
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,147
You crazy fucker…

142
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,777
-Chan-min!
-Hey!

143
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,114
If you should be hitting someone now,
it should be him instead of me, right?

144
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,240
Hmm?

145
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,159
Ah! My fingers!

146
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,829
Shit! You son of a bitch!
Why are you all fucking standing there?

147
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,875
Ugh, this is fucking bullshit!

148
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:34,962
Asshole!

149
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,132
What do you think you're doing?

150
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,011
A third-year?

151
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,263
What are you doing down here?

152
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,600
Shit! So fucking embarrassing!

153
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,609
I have
a brief announcement to make.

154
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,612
This year's Healing Forest retreat
will go ahead as planned.

155
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,239
All the details
will be posted in the group chat.

156
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,576
If you're unable to attend,
please notify me in advance.

157
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,828
That's all.

158
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,545
Jae-i.

159
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,425
Hang on. Can we talk for a minute?

160
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,679
Yeah.

161
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:28,933
Just say it.

162
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,309
Don't worry about her.

163
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,356
You heard her.

164
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,237
I'm sorry… about the other night.

165
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,492
-I'm sorry if what I did offended you--
-Scholarship kid.

166
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,785
Kang Ha. That's my name.

167
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,121
Not "scholarship kid." Kang Ha.

168
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,874
Whatever your name is,
we were just fooling around at a party.

169
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,418
That's it. I hate it when guys get clingy.

170
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,005
Oh, do you want some advice?

171
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,800
I'm paying you back
for the shirt you lent me the other day.

172
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:09,932
Drop out.

173
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,016
"Drop out"?

174
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,477
Why should I drop out now?

175
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:17,189
Ri-an hates you, so that's the only thing
you can do to defend yourself.

176
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,359
Ah.

177
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,529
If it's about that,
I can take care of myself.

178
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,613
And also…

179
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,491
…I liked kissing you.

180
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,370
I liked that it was you.

181
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,789
And I really liked that you didn't

182
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,457
push me away.

183
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,760
I'm rooting for you,

184
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,013
this passionate romance
between the classes.

185
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,018
But what made you choose Jae-i?
There were plenty of girls there.

186
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,269
She was pretty.

187
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,353
What?

188
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,440
She was the prettiest.

189
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:00,941
That night.

190
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,819
Out of every girl there.

191
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,700
That's it?

192
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,247
You put your life on the line
all because she was… cute?

193
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,097
I mean,
I thought I had to do something.

194
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,098
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,017
Whatever I did,

196
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,561
I'm sorry for everything.

197
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,744
How do I look? Pretty cool, huh?

198
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,330
It suits you.

199
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,332
Hop in. I'll give you a ride somewhere.

200
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,209
Shall we?

201
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,135
Got you on camera.

202
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,595
Ah!

203
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,238
What are you eating?

204
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,699
-Ice cream.
-All to yourself? You're not gonna share?

205
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,033
Here. Here, have some.

206
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,953
-Ah!
-Ah.

207
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,497
I'm gonna need you a little closer.

208
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,249
-Give it to me.
-Ah!

209
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,459
Seriously! Hey!

210
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,502
Enough!

211
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,172
Hey, hey.

212
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,841
Hey!

213
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,012
Are you sorry?
Don't mess with people's food.

214
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,597
Ice cream or me?

215
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,598
Ice cream.

216
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,517
Huh? Get back here.

217
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,853
Now you're in for it.

218
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,356
Say "ah!"

219
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,316
Come on, open wide!
I can't reach that far.

220
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,986
-Ah!
-Ah-- Hey!

221
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,070
That was your fault!

222
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,156
-You're right. It's my fault.
-You admit it?

223
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,115
I admit it.

224
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:14,950
-But one thing.
-What?

225
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,454
Are you willing
to beat up your boyfriend over ice cream?

226
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,748
-Well, you deserved it.
-Ice cream or me. Choose.

227
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,624
-Well, it's obvious…
-Oh yeah?

228
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,293
-I choose…
-Yes?

229
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,170
-Ice cream.
-Not gonna cry, are you?

230
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,713
Come here.

231
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,507
-Seriously, come here!
-Aren't you just a hopeless romantic?

232
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,676
You know, this is a bit of a turnoff.

233
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,975
I saw Jae-i outside the hotel.

234
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,778
Are you even listening to me?
Stop moping. It's gross.

235
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,279
Cut it out.

236
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,907
Remember, Jae-i hates it
when guys get too clingy.

237
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,916
I know something you can try.

238
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,293
What are you thinking?

239
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,796
Try dating someone else.

240
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,634
Since you were 15-- No, even longer.

241
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,968
Ever since you guys were six,

242
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,513
you've never given any other girl
so much as a second glance.

243
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,890
Seeing you with someone else
would drive her crazy.

244
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,226
I know if it were me, I'd want you back.

245
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,686
So I should date someone else
to lure her back?

246
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,022
Yeah. Or pretend to. Just be convincing.

247
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,149
Poor girl.

248
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,568
I'm sure she still has feelings for you.

249
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,362
Why else would she drive out here?

250
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,907
You need to get smart about this soon
if you're serious about winning her back.

251
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,575
This is your only shot.

252
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:41,578
Well then…

253
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,251
you should

254
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,795
look into something.

255
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,591
Look into what, exactly?

256
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,927
The reason that she's leaving.

257
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,929
The real reason.

258
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,270
I don't think I can.

259
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,691
No one wants you back together
more than I do, but I'm her best friend.

260
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,192
I can't start spying on her, can I?

261
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,480
-Been a while.
-Good to see you.

262
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,358
Just tell me, already.

263
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,445
Tell you what?

264
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,197
We both know you have a secret.

265
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,908
Why suffer through it alone?

266
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:02,743
You can share.

267
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,167
Let me take this.

268
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,420
Looks like I'm not
the only one with a secret.

269
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,755
What happened to sharing?

270
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,259
I'll be right back.

271
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,484
If you keep ignoring me,

272
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,070
I'll consider sending this
to your father too.

273
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,613
…your father too.

274
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,829
This is the email address
for the secretary's office

275
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,122
at Jaeyul Group, right?

276
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,019
You said you took care of it.

277
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,522
You deleted everything, right?
So what's the problem?

278
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,825
You're positive?

279
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,868
You're sure you did?

280
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,953
Yes, I'm sure.

281
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,290
I checked twice.
No, three times. I'm absolutely sure.

282
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,125
What do I do now?

283
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,127
What's gonna happen to me?
What the hell do I do?

284
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,839
Don't worry, we'll find a way.

285
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,424
No, it's too late for that.

286
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,842
I did everything I could.

287
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,263
-Jae-i.
-You have no idea.

288
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,806
You don't know what my dad is like.

289
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,060
When he finds out,
he'll hide me away like my mom.

290
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,562
Or he'll just kill me.

291
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,606
At this point,

292
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,944
it'd be better if I just…
if I just died before it gets out.

293
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,321
We'll figure something out.

294
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,989
I can help you.

295
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,074
I'm so scared

296
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,118
I'll end up like my mom!

297
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,078
I'm scared that my dad will kill me!

298
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,342
Wait.

299
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:28,889
Don't tell me…

300
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,141
Jae-i? What? Hey! Hey!

301
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,602
-What are you doing in here?
-Jae-i!

302
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,104
-Get out before we beat you.
-Jae-i! Wait, please!

303
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,314
-Jae-i!
-Get out!

304
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:50,160
How about it?
Are you interested in speaking to me now?

305
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,846
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

306
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,723
I'm tired. See you later.

307
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,862
You nearly had it!

308
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,030
Close one, Dad.

309
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,338
Chairman Jung.

310
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,344
I said don't disturb me.

311
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,390
What?

312
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,605
What was uploaded?

313
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,361
Confirm the details and stand by for now.

314
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,706
Tell me it isn't true, Jung Jae-i.

315
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,213
No daughter of mine
could do something like that.

316
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,341
I'd expect this kind of thing
out of your filthy, low-class mother.

317
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,469
But you? There's no way.

318
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,805
I refuse to believe
my daughter would humiliate me like this.

319
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,517
Answer me.

320
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,645
Don't stand there gaping like a fool!

321
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,445
Answer me right now!

322
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,033
I'm afraid I have to go.

323
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,706
An issue has come up at work.

324
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,752
Oh really? It must be bad news.

325
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,463
Something odd was posted
on the board members' forum.

326
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,840
I have to assess the situation.

327
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,553
I feel awful. We haven't been
hunting together for a while.

328
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,514
Now I've gone and ruined it.

329
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,975
Don't rush coming back down.

330
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,954
There we go. Now the lemon zest.

331
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:43,291
Director Jang called.
He's been trying to reach you all morning.

332
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,585
Everything's all right at work?

333
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,754
Of course it is. We're fine.

334
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,215
And have you heard back from Jooshin?

335
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,386
I told you not to worry.

336
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,681
Oh. Is it today already?

337
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,642
Only the most special day of the year!

338
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:04,563
The day that I get to prepare
my daughter's breakfast myself!

339
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,279
Come see me at the house later.

340
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,615
Am I your servant now?

341
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,412
That shit is so funny, man.

342
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,622
That's not the craziest part.
Later…

343
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,790
Hey.

344
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,667
Let's go.

345
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,324
They spiked my drink
with something.

346
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,993
It had to be some kind of drug.

347
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,624
I almost died.

348
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,375
I'm serious.

349
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:13,048
Wait. In-han. Just try and calm down.
You think high school kids would do that?

350
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,633
You have no idea

351
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,136
what kind of place Jooshin is…

352
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,349
what kind of people they are.

353
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,827
Were your parent's fired
from Jooshin or something?

354
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,913
Were they contractors
whose business dried up?

355
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,456
Who the hell are you?

356
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,583
What's your deal, huh?

357
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,503
Everyone keeps telling me you're the one
who runs things around here.

358
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,464
I'm only doing what I need to survive.

359
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,676
If I have to go up against you
to do that, so be it.

360
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,802
That true?

361
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:00,887
You sure?

362
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,397
You see, I wanna know
what you're up to, scholarship kid.

363
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:12,982
Try me.

364
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,778
We'll see how long you last.

365
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,493
In-han was being bullied, assaulted,

366
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,912
and Kim Ri-an was behind it.

367
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,582
Could he have spiked In-han's drink too?

368
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,685
We need to deal with him
at the Healing Forest.

369
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,645
If we wait any longer, we're dead!

370
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,690
But, Chan-min, he didn't even flinch
when you tried to hit him.

371
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,401
How do we get
someone like that to drop out?

372
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,236
We just have to kill his spirit!

373
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,946
Either we kick his face in

374
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,699
or deal with him like Kang In-han,

375
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,242
make him disappear.

376
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,787
No one would bat an eye
if another lowlife died anyway.

377
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,415
Get off your fucking phone
when I'm talking to you!

378
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,834
Ugh! These fucking idiots!

379
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:19,215
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

380
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,857
Ms. Han asked me to bring you this.

381
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,317
Mm-hmm.

382
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,069
How's it going?

383
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,446
And how is everyone?

384
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,907
Who exactly do you mean by that?

385
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,367
Ri-an, Jae-i, Woo-jin, He-ra.

386
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,203
I'm talking about your friends.

387
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,704
My friends?

388
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,665
They're all fine.

389
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,834
Don't waste your time
with the wrong people.

390
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,504
The friends you make here
will last a lifetime.

391
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,924
They'll be very helpful
when you start your career.

392
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,926
You understand what I mean, don't you?

393
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,804
Yes.

394
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,434
One thing, Mom.

395
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,813
How did you cover it up?

396
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,234
In-han's death, I mean.

397
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,153
You made sure
there wasn't even a single article.

398
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,197
I'm curious how.

399
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,785
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

400
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,995
Go on, you'll be late.

401
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,723
You have to open it.

402
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,059
I saw Kim Ri-an put drugs
into Choi Yun-seok's locker.

403
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,983
It's against school policy
to open a student's personal locker.

404
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,359
It's a breach of privacy.

405
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,778
If you don't open it for me,
I'll file a formal complaint.

406
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,739
A formal complaint? For?

407
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,159
You saw me being attacked
in the classroom, and you just ignored it.

408
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,416
Kang Ha, a school is a tiny society.

409
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,044
At Jooshin, we give students the freedom
to resolve minor issues amongst themselves

410
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,088
to help them function within that society.

411
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,841
Help us? Help us how?

412
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:28,803
Help us learn respect for the bosses' sons
since they'll be our bosses in the future?

413
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,680
Help us remember we're poor,

414
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,349
and that we'd better get used to
getting walked all over?

415
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,352
That doesn't sound much like "help" to me.
Or does it to you?

416
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,270
Kang Ha!

417
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,522
Maybe I should let the press know
about my assault,

418
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,691
about Jooshin's special rules.

419
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:42,650
Everything.

420
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:31,950
Boo!

421
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,117
Oh, you scared me.

422
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,286
I'm so hungry. Buy me a yogurt?

423
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,496
-Yogurt?
-Mm-hmm.

424
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:37,872
Come on.

425
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:38,957
-Strawberry?
-Sure.

426
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,221
Is this it?
Is this what you were talking about?

427
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,598
You see? We need an investigation.

428
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,724
Find out what these are.

429
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,977
Find out who is dealing them
to who at school, and also,

430
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,521
who they might have fed them to.

431
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,022
This is Xanax.

432
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,733
They're for anxiety disorders.

433
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:10,196
I don't know if these were prescribed
at your old school, but they are here.

434
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,907
Most kids are under so much pressure,
they need them.

435
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:17,161
Go check with a police station
or hospital if you don't believe me.

436
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,001
Just put it back before anyone finds out.

437
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,672
And don't cause any trouble.

438
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,020
If someone's sending you
anonymous DMs,

439
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,771
can you find out who they are?

440
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,648
I'm not sure.

441
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,108
Why do you ask?

442
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,361
Well, you said you knew
a good harassment lawyer.

443
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,697
Oh, yes, I do.

444
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,742
Eun-gyeong used this firm
to go after her Internet trolls.

445
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,620
But the social media sites
don't like disclosing user info.

446
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,289
So it's hard to find out who's behind it.

447
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,916
You know, I don't really care
if it's legal or not.

448
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,669
Just find someone
who can track anonymous accounts.

449
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,882
How would I do that though?

450
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,844
I imagine way more people
are in your circle--

451
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,721
You remember Woo-jin's birthday?

452
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,432
Someone took a video.

453
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,559
Sorry, what?

454
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,478
And that someone still has it too.

455
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,562
Wait.

456
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,106
Wait. Who has it?

457
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,067
Wait, why? And how? What was recorded?

458
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,486
Was there anything bad in particular?

459
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,696
Was there anything
that happened at that party

460
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,114
that you'd want recorded

461
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,284
and shared with everyone?

462
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,583
Do whatever it takes.
I need to expose this account.

463
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,050
Hey, how's this one?

464
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,888
-Yeah, looks good.
-Should I choose one more?

465
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,140
How long is this year's
Healing Forest retreat again?

466
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,350
It's a day, right?

467
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,143
What was that guy's name?

468
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,312
Kang…

469
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,398
That kid who died?

470
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,608
Kang In-han?

471
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,777
He died the day of
Woo-jin's birthday party, didn't he?

472
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,278
Yeah, he did. You're right.

473
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,941
This is Yoon He-ra. How have you been?

474
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,360
I need your help with something.

475
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,145
Everybody, listen up.

476
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,981
We are about to begin
today's floating session.

477
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,525
Relax your body and slowly lay back.

478
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,659
Take a deep breath in.

479
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,286
Inhale.

480
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,174
Good shot!

481
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,809
I haven't seen that kid today.

482
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,645
-Have you guys?
-I saw him earlier.

483
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,274
What do you think, guys? Is this it?
Kang Ha's last night on earth?

484
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,400
Oh, tonight?

485
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,195
I assume Chan-min
and the scholarship students wanna live.

486
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,739
-So they've got something planned.
-It better be something good.

487
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,823
Let's make it interesting.

488
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,325
Hey, Tae-ho, wanna bet on it?

489
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,952
Bet what?

490
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,995
I'll bet a million won
on the scholarship kid.

491
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,956
I bet he's stubborn enough to survive.

492
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,166
Me too. A million won
he makes it to tomorrow.

493
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,710
Oh. My million won says
he doesn't last the night.

494
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,170
A deal is a deal. All right, guys?

495
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,547
Park Tae-ho? How do you bet?

496
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,302
I also bet a million he doesn't.

497
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,846
Okay! That's two million if you lose.

498
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,682
-Yeah? Make it five.
-Five?

499
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,558
I raise you five more. Now it's ten.

500
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,105
Just pretend you're on a normal trip
with a normal school. This is your room.

501
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,275
These are more tucked away,
better for the scholarship students.

502
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,192
Okay.

503
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,028
Sign up at the information desk
for any sessions you want.

504
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,073
My advice.

505
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,784
Do yourself a favor,
and choose the least popular ones.

506
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,661
We'll see. Thanks, man.

507
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,955
This doesn't make us friends.

508
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,749
Don't talk to me in front of the others.

509
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,669
There's a reason they call me "Moss."

510
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,963
My existence is barely noticed.

511
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,174
-That's a shitty name to call someone.
-I'm not offended by it.

512
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,929
I've worked hard for a long time
to earn that nickname.

513
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,764
I'm not about to ruin it.

514
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:31,892
Not for anyone.

515
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,565
Well, thanks for the advice.

516
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,875
I've started looking into your problem.

517
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:59,211
You know, whoever's behind this account,
if they were at the party with us,

518
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,464
that probably means it's someone we know.

519
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:05,092
You'd think our friends would know better
than to try pulling this shit on us.

520
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,052
What do they want?

521
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,179
I don't know.

522
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,764
They never actually said.

523
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,641
Maybe they're hoping to make a buck
by threatening to make it public.

524
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,311
But who at the party
would be so desperate or stupid enough

525
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,104
to try and blackmail us for money?

526
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:21,025
Send me those DMs when you get a chance.
I'll get someone on it.

527
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,239
I'll send the messages on my own.

528
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,913
You must be
in serious trouble, Jae-i.

529
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,833
You weren't the only one filmed doing
something you shouldn't have been doing.

530
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,339
Brunch, anyone?

531
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,643
I haven't even touched my food,

532
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:57,937
but my appetite's gone.

533
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,690
-Could it be the vibes?
-Yeah, and I think it's contagious.

534
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,942
Because I feel the same way.

535
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,778
It's been forever
since we all hung out.

536
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,279
Can't you get along for one day?

537
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,325
I'm gonna head out.

538
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,580
Stay. You said you wanted to be friends.

539
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,334
There's no reason to avoid me
if you meant it.

540
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,128
Don't you remember what you told me?

541
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:25,047
That you would do "whatever it takes"
to try and get us back together.

542
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,347
That's reason enough, don't you think?

543
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,185
Hey, Jae-i!

544
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,938
Wait. I'll walk you back!

545
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,199
So my plan.

546
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,826
You thought about it?

547
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:59,165
Forget about the plan, He-ra.
It'll never work.

548
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:02,001
Jae-i would see through
a fake relationship in a second.

549
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,296
-She'd know.
-With the right girl, she might not.

550
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,590
I'll do it.

551
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,760
You? Why? What makes you
so perfect for the job?

552
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,763
It has to be someone Jae-i would believe,

553
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:18,642
but also someone who's willing to back off
the moment she starts to get jealous.

554
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,060
Trust me. I'm your only option.

555
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,439
I wasn't going to tell you this,

556
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,026
but even though
Jae-i still has feelings for you,

557
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,028
she's crushing on the scholarship kid.

558
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,867
I can clearly tell
just from the look in her eyes.

559
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,577
If you don't do something fast,

560
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,621
it'll be too late to ever win her back.

561
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:04,146
I thought I packed all the meds,
but I forgot to bring any antacids.

562
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,232
Three boxes should be plenty.

563
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,737
Kang Ha.

564
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,241
I chose you for this
to help you avoid the other students.

565
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,660
Well, thanks, I guess.

566
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:20,454
Call me cowardly if you want,
but that's how this place works.

567
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,749
All I can do
is try to make the best of the situation.

568
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,459
You don't need to explain it to me.

569
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,712
This place is just cowardly adults
afraid of insane children.

570
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,048
I'm not even curious why anymore.

571
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,356
Whoa!

572
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,524
Hey.

573
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,235
Jesus! You startled me!
I nearly ran you over!

574
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,863
-Are you going somewhere?
-Uh-huh.

575
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,074
On an errand to the drugstore.

576
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,246
Go on. I need to get more cigarettes.

577
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,497
What?

578
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,000
What? You want me to pedal?

579
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,505
Huh? Isn't that Jae-i?

580
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,595
Yep, that's her with the scholarship kid.

581
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,597
Hold on.

582
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,638
Feels good.

583
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,558
Hmm? What's that? I didn't hear.

584
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,853
Ah. You like the beach? Wanna stop by?

585
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,773
It's fine. Just keep going.

586
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,067
Sure.

587
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:07,913
You want this?

588
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,791
No, thanks. I'm fine.

589
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,925
I don't think it'll let up anytime soon.

590
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,435
Aw.

591
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,980
You're so cute.

592
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,654
Ah!

593
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,536
You're pretty.

594
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:49,747
What?

595
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,083
You know, you're pretty when you laugh.

596
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,837
I've never even seen you smile before.

597
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,095
I don't understand it.

598
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,556
You're pretty, smart, popular,

599
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,434
and rich enough to have
whatever you want in your life.

600
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,478
You got everything.

601
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,521
But you never smile.

602
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,692
That's just the way I was raised.

603
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,071
I was taught to conceal my emotions
around others.

604
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:26,033
"Laughter today becomes gossip tomorrow."

605
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,118
"And if anyone sees you cry,

606
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,246
it's only a matter of time
before they use it against you."

607
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,166
Wait. That's how they raised you?

608
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,169
Mm-hmm. From the age of three.

609
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,005
Wow.

610
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,217
The rich really aren't
like the rest of us, are they?

611
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,179
What about you?

612
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,348
Everyone's always bullying you
for being poor.

613
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,225
What do you have to smile about
all the time?

614
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:52,935
What?

615
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,728
Who says I'm poor?

616
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,397
That's funny.

617
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,067
I never thought of myself
as being poor or unhappy.

618
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,276
At least I didn't…

619
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:08,951
…until I came here.

620
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,592
The rain isn't stopping. Let's just go.

621
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,761
Hey, Jae-i, wait for me.

622
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,513
Oh, right. The bike.

623
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:32,766
Jae-i.

624
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,393
Hey, Jae-i.

625
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:35,936
One second.

626
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,982
Put this on. You'll catch a cold.

627
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:43,694
There you go.

628
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:48,574
Jae-i.

629
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:51,785
Shit!

630
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,798
Remember, when you see him,
grab him by the arms.

631
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,216
We'll either beat him up

632
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,468
or light a fire in here
and lock him inside.

633
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,179
We're gonna teach him
a lesson he'll never forget.

634
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,682
Understand?

635
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,143
Answer me.

636
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,691
I'll see ya.

637
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,443
Wait.

638
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,823
Dry your shirt. I have a closet steamer.

639
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,998
This place is really amazing.

640
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,335
I heard the suites here
can cost a few million won a night.

641
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,669
I wish they put me up in one.

642
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,338
That's nothing. Get this.

643
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,299
Ri-an and Jae-i's villas
were close to ten million won each.

644
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:50,385
Wow! Must be nice
to be born with a silver spoon.

645
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:53,680
If only they'd been born
with some manners to go along with it.

646
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,224
These kids order their teachers around
like we're housekeepers.

647
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,478
I'm not sure
how much longer I'll last here.

648
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:00,562
You have it the worst!

649
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:04,274
Your class has Ri-an,
He-ra, Jae-i, Woo-jin too.

650
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,735
I don't think I would be able
to come to work!

651
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,947
Those kids aren't too bad, actually.

652
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,950
It's some of the other students
who give me more trouble.

653
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,451
Hey.

654
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,128
Excuse me, Ms. Han?
The principal wants to see you.

655
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:27,756
Okay.

656
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,300
You'll have to excuse me.

657
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,760
-Go!
-Of course!

658
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,139
Hang on.

659
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,142
What would Principal Park
want with Ms. Han at this hour?

660
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,353
Who cares? Let's drink.

661
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,312
Okay.

662
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,526
Is something wrong?

663
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,779
My girlfriend isn't answering the phone.

664
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,950
Ah. Yeah, I left my cell phone behind
in my room to charge.

665
00:49:57,452 --> 00:50:00,706
Wait. Did Principal Park
really ask to see me or not?

666
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,502
I've got wine in my room. Let's go back.

667
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,621
Where is Kang Ha?

668
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,290
What the hell's going on?

669
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,834
Does he know we're here?

670
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:46,877
Message the guys.

671
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,171
Get them to find out
what happened to this prick.

672
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,423
And where the fuck are the others?

673
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:54,551
There are supposed to be
four fucking guys here! I mean, Jesus!

674
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,683
Take this. It's a change of clothes.

675
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,394
It's fine, really.
I'm not that wet anymore.

676
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,979
I'll leave as soon as my shirt's ready.

677
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,316
Well, suit yourself.

678
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:17,282
Do you know
if Kang Ha and Jae-i are close?

679
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,201
Who?

680
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:20,994
You know, Kang Ha the new student.

681
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,080
Ah, the scholarship kid.

682
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,499
Why are you asking?

683
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,503
DRYING

684
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,587
Good evening.

685
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,682
Has filming a gangster movie
rubbed off on you?

686
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,560
You're not angry, are you?

687
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,438
No.

688
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,942
If you're tired, go sleep on the bed.

689
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,402
No, no. I'm awake.

690
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,947
Why don't we go somewhere
and have a chat?

691
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,953
Didn't you just come
from the film set? You must be tired.

692
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,099
I didn't hate it either,

693
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:25,725
you know?

694
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:27,853
Hmm?

695
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,899
The night of the party,
when you kissed me.

696
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,738
Honestly, I didn't hate it either.

697
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,875
Walking together? Where to?

698
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,213
Jae-i's villa.

699
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,465
I saw them going in together.

700
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,633
You did?

701
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:43,845
Are you sure?

702
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,472
Yeah.

703
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,474
I saw them when I came back.

704
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,896
Just hang on--

705
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,445
I need to go out for a bit.

706
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,155
Okay.

707
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,034
I know it's late, Principal Park.

708
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,537
But you need to come here now
with the master key.

709
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,412
I can help you.

710
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:20,900
What's going on here?

711
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,404
What do you think you're doing?

712
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:06,696
PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM
KANG HA

713
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,112
All of you,

714
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,489
you're worse than I thought.

715
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,325
Hmm? I didn't know ghosts could talk.

716
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,537
Why'd you even bother coming?
You're getting expelled today.

717
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,038
I can't believe it.

718
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,874
A scholarship student
breaking into Jae-i's room?

719
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,586
I thought you were just a puppy dog,
but you're a total stalker.

720
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,921
Ugh, he's such a creep.

721
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,589
How much did we bet?
Five million?

722
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,425
-Don't remember.
-It was ten million!

723
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,927
-Man, I'm hungry.
-Wanna grab a burger?

724
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,388
Ri-an, where are you going?

725
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,849
You headed
to the disciplinary hearing as well?

726
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,392
Let's do it.

727
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,269
The thing.

728
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:20,645
What do you mean?

729
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,397
Your fake relationship idea.

730
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,108
Let's do it.

731
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,204
I'm sure you're aware
why we asked you here, Mr. Kang Ha.

732
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,290
You've been accused of
entering Ms. Jung Jae-i's room

733
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,041
without permission
during a school retreat.

734
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,460
Do you deny this charge?

735
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:45,879
Answer the question!

736
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,547
There's no need for any questions.

737
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,340
I witnessed him there myself.

738
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:53,136
At least try to explain
how it happened, Kang Ha.

739
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,053
And if I did?

740
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,183
Would anyone believe a word I said?

741
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,684
This is Jooshin, Kang Ha.

742
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:02,353
We demand the utmost standard
of behavior from our students.

743
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,855
More than any other school in Korea.

744
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,983
And a student who refuses
to show any shred of remorse

745
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:09,027
cannot hope to be given a second chance.

746
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,697
In accordance with Article 12
of the Jooshin High School regulations,

747
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,158
tainting the school's honor
and disorderly behavior,

748
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:18,661
we intend to expel Kang Ha
from his second year, class two.

749
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,542
He wasn't trespassing. I invited him in.

750
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,711
Jae-i.

751
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:29,088
He was just bringing over
something I asked for.

752
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,590
That's the only reason he was there.

753
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,926
If you really need to punish someone,

754
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,845
then punish me.

755
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:37,764
Come on.

756
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,642
Wait, you…

757
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,312
I don't believe this.

758
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,398
I came here
to personally ask the committee

759
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,108
to punish him for what he did to you.

760
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,361
What are you doing?

761
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,198
I said, what are you doing?

762
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:01,746
From now on, you leave Kang Ha alone.

763
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:03,998
What?

764
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,333
And before you ask,

765
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:06,834
I'm not using him.

766
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,384
I like him, all right?

767
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,140
You lay a hand on him, you answer to me.

768
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:22,976
Stop.

769
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,313
This is Jooshin,

770
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,232
Jung Jae-i.

771
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,735
Don't start something you can't handle.

772
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,113
I don't care where we are.

773
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,867
I'm still Jung Jae-i, Kim Ri-an.
