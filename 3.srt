1
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,961
HIERARCHY

2
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,594
Why'd you do that?

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,305
I could have dealt with it myself.

4
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:59,267
Because of what you just did for me,
people are going to turn on you.

5
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,019
Kang Ha.

6
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,068
Why did you really come to this school?

7
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,621
So I guess… you know who I am.

8
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,305
I came here for one reason.

9
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,394
Mm-hmm.

10
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,979
I'm here to take your place.

11
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,400
I'm trying to be number one.

12
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:53,071
I heard if I'm top student,
Jooshin will pay for me to study abroad,

13
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,241
and when applying to foreign branches,
I'd get priority consideration.

14
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,828
Up till now, you were always
the top student, weren't you?

15
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,831
No scholarship student
has ever received those benefits.

16
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,708
Well, I'll be the first one.

17
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,419
So watch out. I'm coming for ya.

18
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,588
They're just grades to you, but

19
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,300
it could be… a life-changing opportunity

20
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:16,845
for me.

21
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,742
Was that little show
really necessary?

22
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,370
The kiss? What I said earlier
should have been enough.

23
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,746
I've been perfectly clear to you.

24
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,959
Who I like and what I choose to do
with them has nothing to do with you.

25
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,784
NO SIBLINGS

26
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,961
Why did you really come
to this school?

27
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,089
So I guess… you know who I am.

28
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,509
Kang In-han.

29
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,721
Kang Ha.

30
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,420
Let's go together.

31
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,132
You know, if we're gonna do this,
I figure we'd better put on a show.

32
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,260
We should show up at school together.

33
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,220
Make it more… convincing.

34
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,017
Or not.

35
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,353
-If you don't want--
-Come down when I call.

36
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,321
I'll be back.

37
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,474
EPISODE 3
HIERARCHY: A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN

38
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,401
Oh. Jae-i?

39
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,324
What? Well, don't just stand there.
Get in.

40
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,584
Stop staring at it. It won't fall off.

41
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,046
Oh, I'm not worried about that.

42
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,505
Then what?

43
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,549
It's cute.

44
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,927
Seeing your car and my bike together.

45
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,145
Ugh, how tacky. What's with the bracelet?

46
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,024
Ah! So it's a friendship bracelet
from Seonyul.

47
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,777
-"Seonyul"?
-The orchestra I'm in.

48
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,529
Remember at your place?
On the day that you and I first met?

49
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,823
I was there with other musicians, playing.

50
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,077
You all wear the same bracelet
in your music group?

51
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,119
Mm-hmm.

52
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,246
Is it tacky though?

53
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,791
I thought it looked pretty cool.

54
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,360
Let's go in. You don't wanna be late.

55
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,908
-Holding hands!
-Is this real? Not a prank?

56
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,827
-Crazy!
-Seriously? For real?

57
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,579
Big news.
Jae-i and Kang Ha are holding hands.

58
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,456
-What the heck?
-Wait, wait.

59
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,376
-I need to get this on camera.
-Hold up, hold up, hold up.

60
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,002
Are they actually dating?

61
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,015
What is it? Is there some kind of problem?

62
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,352
Oh, no. No problem here.

63
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,368
I've never seen her holding hands
with a boy other than Ri-an.

64
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,206
What does she see in that kid?
What has he got?

65
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,293
Don't you have a class to go teach?

66
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,503
Uh…

67
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,088
Right.

68
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,925
Oh, looks like the gloves are off.

69
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,179
Did you see the photos?

70
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,347
Are those two serious, like, for real?

71
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,600
Guys, let's dial it back a bit.

72
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,060
Everybody's been gossiping about it.

73
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:58,978
She's our friend,

74
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,023
so I think we should keep it down
and support her decision.

75
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,066
Damn! So it's real! Oh my God!

76
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,693
What about our sexy bad boy?

77
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,944
Ri-an.

78
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,322
-Are they really over?
-Looks like it.

79
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,741
Otherwise, she wouldn't
go out with someone else.

80
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,659
And who's to say.

81
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,996
Maybe Ri-an has also found someone new.

82
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,706
Hey.

83
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,930
What's all this?

84
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,139
It's chocolate.

85
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,475
It's for you.

86
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,280
Help yourselves.

87
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,616
I have to go to
a special class this morning.

88
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,621
I feel kinda bad for Kim Seon-u.

89
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:02,208
That guy falls all over himself for her,
and she doesn't even bat an eye.

90
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,209
I know, right?

91
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,131
He's done it since they slept together
at Woo-jin's party, remember?

92
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,216
Hey!

93
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,760
Be quiet. Somebody might hear you.

94
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,845
Who cares. Everyone already knows.

95
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,139
It doesn't matter.
You shouldn't be gossiping.

96
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,683
What if He-ra heard you?

97
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,560
She'd kill you.

98
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,769
JOOSHIN HIGH SCHOOL

99
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:22,895
Calm down.

100
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,197
What's up, fam?

101
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,911
That's where Jae-i sits.

102
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,788
I'm being kind.

103
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:44,041
Ri-an wouldn't be able to concentrate
if Jae-i sat here today.

104
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,968
-What is that?
-Oh, well, this is, uh--

105
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,553
It's our seat.

106
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,771
I'm going to take this class with Jae-i
from now on. Good to see you all.

107
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,524
What?
Do you even know what this class is?

108
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,693
This is a special class
just for the four of us.

109
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,403
This isn't something
just anyone can take--

110
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,571
"Just anyone"?

111
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,282
He-ra.

112
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,417
I took care of his tuition and schedule.

113
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,546
If you don't like it, I'll make
a separate class for just us two.

114
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,051
Good afternoon.

115
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,312
So are you gonna start?

116
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,272
Right.

117
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:54,111
Today, we'll start by looking
into the literature of the 20th century.

118
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,323
Does anyone know of
any famous poets from this era?

119
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,509
Really?
You're gonna let this happen?

120
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,469
She's even bringing him into our classes!

121
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,389
Shouldn't we do something?

122
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,601
I think you should be upfront
and tell her that we're seeing each other.

123
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,520
You gotta provoke her to get a reaction.

124
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,065
Wait, Ri-an!

125
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,822
Don't be too much, He-ra.

126
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,501
Wha--

127
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,046
She's the problem here.
Why is he taking it out on me?

128
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,593
Hello.

129
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:08,978
Kang Ha.

130
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,482
Can we chat?

131
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,154
Spit it out. What do you want?

132
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,449
It's…

133
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,410
Hey, I'm sorry.

134
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,622
I didn't do it on purpose, Kang Ha.

135
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,249
What are you doing?

136
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,543
You already know my position.

137
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,504
I did stuff to you
'cause I felt pressured to do it

138
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,548
against my will. I'm sorry.

139
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,926
And why is that?

140
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,053
'Cause of Jae-i?

141
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,852
Don't treat me differently
'cause I'm dating her.

142
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,604
I'm still a scholarship student.

143
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,981
It's kinda silly,
don't you think, Chan-min?

144
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,983
My dad works for Jaeyul.

145
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,529
What if you kick my ass?

146
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,032
Beat the crap out of me, Kang Ha!

147
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,867
Yeah, I'll just, uh,

148
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,161
lie right here.

149
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,039
Do what you want.
Come on. Bring it on. Lay it on me.

150
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,582
What's wrong?

151
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,459
Want a stick? Is that what it is?

152
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,669
I'll find you one.

153
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,005
Here. Take this.

154
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:23,093
Smack me with it
until it breaks, but

155
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,971
please don't tell Jae-i anything bad.

156
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,559
I'm starting to notice
that no one here has a spine.

157
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,230
Figures. If you did, you wouldn't have
banded together to bully someone

158
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,690
just 'cause you were terrified
of big, bad Ri-an.

159
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,733
Right?

160
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,168
Well, this shit's gonna
be a goddamn headache.

161
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,549
Ow!

162
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,929
Do you think that means
Jae-i and Ri-an are officially over now?

163
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,597
Jae-i seems to think so,

164
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,517
but Ri-an… still wants her.

165
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,769
It's all crazy.

166
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,273
Why is she with that scholarship kid
all of a sudden?

167
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,816
She's acting out.

168
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,402
It won't last.

169
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,195
It doesn't mean anything.

170
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,697
I'm kinda worried.

171
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,116
It's riling up the school.

172
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,453
We don't want another tragedy to happen.

173
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,258
Wait, what are you doing?
What if someone sees us?

174
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,551
Who cares if they see?

175
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,469
Nothing'll happen.

176
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,180
Don't worry, Ms. Han. It'll be all right.

177
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,437
Later.

178
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:16,457
DON'T PROVOKE RI-AN, HE'S DANGEROUS
THAT'S HOW IT STARTED FOR IN-HAN TOO

179
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,457
That's mine.

180
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,564
It's getting in my head.

181
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,235
She looks at me
with no emotion in her eyes. Nothing.

182
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,994
No matter how hard I think,
it has to be you.

183
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,164
You left that note
in my locker… didn't you?

184
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,004
LET'S MEET AND TALK

185
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,300
He's right over there.
Let's go ask him.

186
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,847
Hi. Dude, what's your secret?

187
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,725
-What?
-How'd you get close to her?

188
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:40,642
Oh, yeah.

189
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,728
To us scholarship kids,
you're a role model now.

190
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,355
You're dating Queen Jae-i.
So what's your secret?

191
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,150
Also, um, can I get your number?

192
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,496
Okay, focus, focus!

193
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,042
You can do it!

194
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,544
Kim Ri-an! Kim Ri-an!

195
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,842
Blue 15! Blue 15!

196
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,637
Ready.

197
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,640
Set.

198
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,642
Down! Hut!

199
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,430
Yeah!

200
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,437
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

201
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,564
Let's go!

202
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,151
Yeah, let's go, baby!

203
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,071
Kim Ri-an! Kim Ri-an!

204
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,158
Kim Ri-an! Kim Ri-an!

205
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,242
Kim Ri-an!

206
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,368
Yeah!

207
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,370
You're amazing, Ri-an!

208
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,994
That was absolutely unbelievable.

209
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,039
The most incredible
touchdown celebration in history.

210
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,416
I know, right? What a man.

211
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,919
So romantic. What a sexy bad boy.

212
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,588
It totally got me
right in the heart.

213
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,840
Wait!

214
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:20,093
So when you suggested
he might already be into someone else,

215
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:21,803
you meant yourself!

216
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,222
Get it, girl!

217
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:27,309
Well, I'd be lying
if I said I didn't have an idea.

218
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,061
But yeah. I kinda figured.

219
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,564
And you just kept us in the dark.
I'm disappointed, Queen He-ra.

220
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,734
"Queen He-ra"?

221
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,277
You've advanced to queen.

222
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,072
You're Ri-an's new girlfriend,
who he kissed publicly.

223
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,950
Stop it.

224
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,915
Oh. It's Seon-u again.

225
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,250
You don't quit.

226
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,002
Get on. We need to talk.

227
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,004
You two go ahead.

228
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,434
Do you think Seon-u rushed over
after what he saw on the field?

229
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,396
-Because Ri-an kissed He-ra?
-Mm-hmm.

230
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,441
Where do you think he took her?
She's okay, right?

231
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,820
By the way,
have you ever been on a motorcycle?

232
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,072
Mm-mm.

233
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,456
He-ra.

234
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,667
"Get on"? "We need to talk"?

235
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,295
How dare you! It's embarrassing.

236
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,505
You like Ri-an?
What happened to… to me and you?

237
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,424
Why are you so curious?

238
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,134
I'm warning you, Seon-u.

239
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,721
Don't overstep your boundaries.

240
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,934
Then why did you sleep with me
when you don't even like me?

241
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,943
'Cause the girls wanted to know
about the cute new student.

242
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,278
Fit and fresh meat.

243
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,282
They were all wondering
what you'd be like in bed. So I found out.

244
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,742
Are you happy?

245
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,368
Are you serious right now?

246
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,537
'Cause I'm… I'm really into you.

247
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,206
Ooh, and why is that?
'Cause we slept together?

248
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,752
If that's why, you're awfully selfish.

249
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,421
It was mediocre. That night.

250
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,758
You're a total bitch, He-ra.

251
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,136
You're a good judge of character.
So leave me alone already.

252
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,930
I'm gonna let Ri-an know
that we slept together!

253
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:29,848
Do it!

254
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,933
Whatever will make you go away.

255
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,356
Are you all right, miss?

256
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,399
Is your GPS broken or something?

257
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,151
You know I left school forever ago.

258
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,279
Leave him alone.

259
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,923
KIM RI-AN, YOON HE-RA, LEE WOO-JIN,
JUNG JAE-I, CHOI YUN-SEOK

260
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,926
DOWNLOADING FIVE FOLDERS
TO YEAR 2, CLASS 2

261
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,971
JOOSHIN HIGH SCHOOL

262
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,872
She's waiting for you, ma'am.

263
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,880
I don't think you have
anything to be worried about.

264
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,425
Rest assured, our staff
keeps a close eye on Ri-an

265
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:32,137
and is carefully overseeing
all aspects of his well-being.

266
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,431
Let's host a parents' night soon.

267
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,766
Will you be in attendance?

268
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,227
I wonder if it's a delayed adolescence.

269
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,771
Ri-an said the strangest thing to me.

270
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,025
He said he wanted
a bit more parental care.

271
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,196
I don't know what he's complaining about
with so many people waiting on him.

272
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,323
If it's attention he wants,
I'll give it to him.

273
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:55,368
After all, it's the role of the parent
to meet their child's needs.

274
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:56,786
You're extraordinary.

275
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,750
Despite being incredibly busy,
your first priority is still your child.

276
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,543
You have my utmost respect.

277
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,213
Let's have
our affiliated companies attend.

278
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,633
We can take care of
any minor business deals while I'm there.

279
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,801
Consider it as good as done, ma'am.

280
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:17,974
Hey, I'm here.

281
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,231
Hey, Tae-ho.

282
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,982
How've you been?

283
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,945
It's weird. This feels like

284
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:31,780
the old days.

285
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,408
Let's head inside. Hmm?

286
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,369
We can catch up over food.

287
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,457
Get your dirty hands off me,
you charity case!

288
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,502
Hey, Tae-ho.

289
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,258
"The only son of Jaeyul Hotel."

290
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,134
That's how they all know me.

291
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,096
No one there knows
where I actually come from.

292
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,348
That's why I avoided you.

293
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,392
Well, you

294
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,144
and In-han.

295
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,896
Look, I get it.

296
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,816
You still tried to help,
and that's what matters.

297
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,364
And I know that you sent
the same note to In-han.

298
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,449
Why'd you come to Jooshin?

299
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,327
And what's going on with Jae-i and you?

300
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,997
Don't do anything dangerous.

301
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,249
I don't know if Jae-i's trying
to rile up Ri-an or what,

302
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,376
but those two have been together
for a very long time.

303
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,377
I know.

304
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,839
That's why I wanted
to get up close and personal.

305
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,550
So you're… messing with Ri-an

306
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,343
on purpose.

307
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,514
In-han called me, you know.

308
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,893
So I know this wasn't an accident.

309
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,648
But not even the police
can figure out who did it to him.

310
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,110
Just said it was a hit-and-run.

311
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,322
So what can you possibly do if even
the police can't do anything about it?

312
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,573
Collect evidence.

313
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,200
Alcohol, drugs, bullying.

314
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,287
The people who did that to In-han,
Kim Ri-an included,

315
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:05,415
I'm going to expose everything
they're getting away with.

316
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,252
So, Tae-ho, I need your help here.

317
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,339
Wha… what could I do?

318
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,091
Get me Kim Ri-an's locker code.

319
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,344
The code?

320
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,763
Choi Yun-seok is
supplying drugs to Kim Ri-an.

321
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,057
I'm sure there's something
in that locker to prove that.

322
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,602
I can't get close to those guys,
but you can.

323
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,605
Honestly,

324
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,232
I know you're right, but I'm just

325
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,109
a little scared.

326
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,403
Please help me out.

327
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,530
Help me.

328
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,180
So,

329
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,474
what did you want to say?

330
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,979
What are you doing dragging He-ra into it?

331
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,987
If I remember… we are now in a place where

332
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,490
who I'm seeing isn't any of
your business anymore, right?

333
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,701
Come on, Ri-an.

334
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:05,910
YOON HE-RA

335
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,421
Did you get home all right?
I just wanted to talk to you.

336
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,506
Are you free right now?

337
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,549
Come over.

338
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:21,801
We can talk here.

339
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,444
You're going to his home? This late?

340
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,322
I just called to talk to him.
You know, just to have a little chat.

341
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,492
And he said come over.

342
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,659
That's wild.

343
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,912
You don't… you don't think
you're moving too fast?

344
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,955
Do I look okay?

345
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,833
I think I'm getting
some nighttime face bloat.

346
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,878
Mm-mm. You're gorgeous.
You're smoking hot.

347
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:57,879
So pretty.

348
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:58,880
-Yeah? Mmm.
-Yes!

349
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,965
Meongnyang, isn't He-ra super pretty?

350
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,010
Yeah, she's gorgeous. Mmm.

351
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,137
Good boy. You're so smart.

352
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,597
I'll call you later, okay?

353
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,117
You got here fast.

354
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,746
Jae-i! Hi!

355
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:39,087
Uh, Ri-an invited me over out of the blue.
I needed to talk to him, so…

356
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,298
I was gonna call him out about today.

357
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,927
I know your relationship has been
on the rocks, but that was uncalled-for.

358
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,305
I mean, especially 'cause
you and I are best friends.

359
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,308
Don't worry, Jae-i.
I'll give him a piece of my mind.

360
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,313
Don't play along
with Ri-an's little games.

361
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,576
"Little games?"

362
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:40,648
It's been quite a while.

363
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:42,775
I know.

364
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,528
The lobby is a lot nicer
than I remember it.

365
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,280
I'll show you inside. Follow me.

366
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,036
Are you going
to kill this one too?

367
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,923
You're sure you did?

368
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,716
Yes, I'm sure.

369
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:53,179
I checked twice.
No, three times. I'm absolutely sure.

370
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,183
When he finds out,
he'll hide me away like my mom.

371
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,689
These aren't
just empty threats. I have everything.

372
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,316
This and also that.

373
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,776
What do you want from me?

374
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,042
What?

375
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,505
Dad's looking for you.

376
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,013
Have you decided on what to wear?

377
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,681
You mean for Parents' Night?

378
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,350
Chairman Park of the Gongseong Group
will be there.

379
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,021
Their second child is
a student at Jooshin.

380
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,398
I've heard of him. He's a first-year.

381
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,900
Well, his oldest boy lives in New York.

382
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,403
We've been discussing it for a while.

383
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:53,197
I think it's time that the two households
get to know each other.

384
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,074
We'll speak to Chairman Park on the night

385
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,285
and arrange a formal gathering
for the near future.

386
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,121
Appa… I'm not ready.

387
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,249
Jae-i.

388
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,169
This has been in the works
since your mother was pregnant.

389
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,546
Since the moment
we found out you were a girl.

390
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,549
This isn't just about you.

391
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:16,429
This is going to affect the way
Jaeyul Group's entire business is run.

392
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,141
I understand what you're saying.
I do, but--

393
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,186
Their scale and
business potential align well with ours.

394
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,355
He's the perfect match, so be careful

395
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,192
to ensure nothing gets
in the way of your role

396
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,401
and its obligations.

397
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,197
And be especially careful
of who you associate with.

398
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,659
Or anything you might do
that could stir up gossip about you.

399
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,286
'Cause you know…

400
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,373
I won't have it.

401
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,570
What are you doing here?

402
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,863
I was waiting for you.

403
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,907
How about I take you today?

404
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,590
Ah! The breeze feels good, right?

405
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,636
This reminds me of the Healing Forest
when we rode that bike together.

406
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,382
Let's stop. Grab a bite to eat.

407
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,472
-Thank you.
-Absolutely. Please enjoy.

408
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,227
Here.

409
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,522
Trust me. This is gonna blow your mind.

410
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,440
It's so good.

411
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,156
Don't like me.

412
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,115
What?

413
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,744
I'm not really into you,
so you shouldn't like me either.

414
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,041
The time I spend with you
is purely out of goodwill.

415
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,837
I don't wanna see
one more person getting hurt.

416
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,047
Not because of me.

417
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,887
Everyone targeted by Ri-an
eventually left.

418
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,598
You're a target now.
So if I don't save you,

419
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,059
you'll be like the others.

420
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:13,022
That's why I'm helping you.
That's all there is.

421
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,858
So stick to your role,
and don't overplay your hand.

422
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,488
Don't mistake… my goodwill
as something else.

423
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,158
No, I got it.

424
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,369
I know what my role is.

425
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:31,249
I won't overplay anything.
But still, can I worry about you?

426
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,627
You worry?

427
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,920
Yeah, I'm concerned.

428
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,713
You seem vulnerable.

429
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,424
Even now, you seem that way.

430
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,052
Your expression is cold and indifferent.

431
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,139
But your eyes tell me otherwise.

432
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,725
You're lonely and afraid.

433
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,781
How was that for performing my part?

434
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,867
Since my current role is
playing Jung Jae-i's boyfriend.

435
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:11,122
What kind of terrible boyfriend would I be
if I didn't care about your feelings?

436
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,251
Hmm? Don't you think?

437
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,109
Good morning, Ms. He-ra.

438
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,569
-Hello, He-ra.
-Hi.

439
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,862
Oh, hi, He-ra.

440
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,160
JAE-I

441
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,671
Hi, Jae-i.

442
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,303
It's crazy, actually.
'Cause I've been meaning to call you.

443
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,598
What happened with the thing I asked you?

444
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,726
What? What thing?

445
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,811
The anonymous account.

446
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:17,688
Ah!

447
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,900
Oh. I've found someone
who can track it down.

448
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,611
They said it'd be hard
to figure out the account holder.

449
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,739
I told them to track the location
if they couldn't track down the owner.

450
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,534
Spill.

451
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,079
-Huh?
-I said spill it.

452
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,124
Tell me why you said
you've been "meaning to call."

453
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,257
I feel bad. I'm sorry.

454
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,344
Bad? For what?

455
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,762
I'm your best friend.

456
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,640
I can't be doing this.

457
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:55,351
I tried convincing him, and I even yelled.

458
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,269
I tried everything possible.

459
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,898
But Ri-an is too hardheaded.

460
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,734
He was struggling so much
after your breakup.

461
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,195
I just couldn't bring myself
to tell him no.

462
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,907
I'm worried of what he might do
if I refuse him.

463
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,662
I know that you might get hurt, Jae-i.

464
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,247
It won't hurt me, He-ra.

465
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,416
I just…

466
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,378
won't allow it.

467
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,048
Won't allow what?

468
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:29,385
You can't just start going out
with my ex all of a sudden

469
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,554
now that he's single.

470
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:39,562
I mean, you have to be aware you're not
really a good match for him, are you?

471
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,939
Remember what I told you?

472
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,400
I said not to play along
with Ri-an's little games.

473
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,071
Hopefully, by now,
you'll understand what I meant.

474
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,703
Get the anonymous account issue
resolved ASAP.

475
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,588
Not a good match for Ri-an, huh?

476
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,358
Isn't this a gig for your school?
Why are you playing your own event?

477
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,777
Scholarship students aren't invited.

478
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:30,821
They really aren't?

479
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,449
No.

480
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,993
I guess… we're just special like that.

481
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,330
It's an event for parents and students,
but they invite the rich kids and not you?

482
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,623
What kind of school is that?

483
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,500
I think it's good.

484
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,878
'Cause those events are awkward,
and I'd rather make money, you know?

485
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,379
I'm good.

486
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,423
Your tie is crooked again.

487
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,966
-Oh.
-In-han was so tidy.

488
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,510
He'd never let this fly.

489
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,262
Hey.

490
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,598
This is all his fault, you know?

491
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,476
He always did it for me.
How does it look now?

492
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,270
There we are. Good!

493
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,692
This is a Valentino dress.

494
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,737
A classic minimalist red dress
with a statement zipper.

495
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,241
This mini dress here
is Prada's newest release.

496
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,159
It has an elegant, timeless design

497
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,578
and would be well-suited
to Ms. Jae-i's figure.

498
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,248
That one will be perfect.

499
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,968
Yes, I think
these will look really nice on you.

500
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,484
There you are.

501
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,903
I approve.

502
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,408
Your expression
is cold and indifferent,

503
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,118
but your eyes tell me otherwise.

504
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,579
You're lonely and afraid.

505
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,422
I trust that all the preparations
are in order?

506
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,856
Sweetheart. Are you seeing someone?

507
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,691
Why are you so dolled up tonight?

508
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,276
Keep your eyes peeled.

509
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,404
See if you can figure out
my secret boyfriend.

510
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,115
Oh, I'll keep 'em wide open.
I'll find that punk.

511
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,416
Is Jae-i's father… also gonna be there?

512
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,501
I think so. Ri-an's mother is as well.

513
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:53,589
And you said
that you and Jae-i are best friends?

514
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,675
Well, I'd say we are.

515
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,470
Would it be all right

516
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,015
if your dad could take advantage
of that connection?

517
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:07,853
What do you mean by that?

518
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:14,109
Uh… my company was
working on a deal with Jooshin.

519
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,737
It didn't go well.

520
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,280
You said it was an important deal.

521
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,241
That's why I'm thinking
of approaching Jaeyul.

522
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,535
Chairman Jung is well-known

523
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,497
for not interacting with people
who aren't on his level.

524
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:31,627
But because he'll be there tonight,
I was hoping you and Jae-i

525
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,172
might be able to arrange
a casual introduction?

526
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,469
I'll speak to Jae-i about it.

527
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:56,902
Jae-i.

528
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,534
Oh, I came here for some work.

529
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,785
Another piano gig.

530
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,330
Wow, you look so incredible tonight.

531
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:11,959
Oh, hold on.

532
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,212
You have a stray hair right here.

533
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,301
Why are you doing this?

534
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,555
I know my reason for keeping you around.

535
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,766
So what's yours?

536
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,311
You say I'm pretty,
and you're worried about me.

537
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,190
Why say those things
when no one's around to hear them?

538
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,778
There is none.

539
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,238
No real reason.

540
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,701
Just 'cause.

541
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:49,288
I'm saying those things 'cause
you're pretty, and I worry about you.

542
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,540
Whenever I see you smiling, I think,

543
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,626
"What's behind that smile?"

544
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,462
"What is he hiding?"

545
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,299
Tell me why I think that.

546
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,438
Oh my. Chairwoman An. Welcome.

547
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,398
Mrs. An, have you been well?

548
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,025
You're not busy for once?

549
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,902
You've never come to
a school event before.

550
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,195
My son said

551
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:24,239
he needed a bit more parental care.

552
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,491
I'm giving it to him.

553
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,205
Good evening, Mrs. An.

554
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,123
-Welcome, Mrs. An
-Good evening.

555
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:35,834
Do you see it?

556
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:39,296
The depth of love and care
I'm showering you with?

557
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,592
All these people here
are our countless affiliates.

558
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:46,845
It's something no other parent
in the world can offer their child.

559
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,140
And I will bequeath
every last one to you, Ri-an.

560
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,484
Now and in the future,

561
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,904
Jooshin will not only lead the way
putting noblesse oblige into action

562
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,574
but also help our students grow
into upstanding young leaders

563
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,077
in both character and intellect.

564
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,262
All right, then.

565
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,931
I propose a toast.

566
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:34,351
To both Jooshin
and to our children's future!

567
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,728
Cheers!

568
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,775
That Bulgari necklace
Ri-an's mom is wearing

569
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,235
is, like, a hundred million.

570
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,403
A hundred million?

571
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,155
Wait, then with her earrings and necklace,
how much is that outfit?

572
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,116
She's on another level.

573
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,536
The Van Cleef Yun-seok's mother has,
you couldn't even pay for.

574
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,749
Are you two just gonna stay here
all night stuffing your faces, huh?

575
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,877
Why don't you get out there and network?

576
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,254
I mean, they all look kinda busy.

577
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:06,717
Go. Didn't I always emphasize
the importance of making connections?

578
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,176
With who? Ugh.

579
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,636
-No, Mom.
-Why are you so clueless?

580
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,221
I really don't want to.

581
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,746
He-ra.

582
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,166
Can I have a word?

583
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,420
-Be right back.
-Okay.

584
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,053
Have you seen Jae-i? Did you ask her?

585
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,388
Not yet, no.

586
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,265
I'll ask her now.

587
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:00,687
Oh, Jae-i.

588
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,986
My dad's looking for a second with yours.
He wants to say hi

589
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,155
and talk to him about something.

590
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,240
It's been a while, Jae-i.

591
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,496
I heard Chairman Jung was here,
so I was hoping we could chat.

592
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,331
You and He-ra are such close friends,

593
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,834
and yet I don't think he and I have ever
gotten the chance to meet.

594
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,086
He's a bit busy.

595
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,297
I'll let him know that you said hello.

596
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,563
I'm not asking for anything crazy.

597
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,148
It's not crazy.

598
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,568
I just have no interest in doing it.

599
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:50,570
What?

600
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,991
I have no desire… to do you a favor.

601
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,310
Your dress.

602
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,605
It's beautiful.

603
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,735
So beautiful, I don't wanna fight you.

604
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,445
At least not today.

605
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,363
We're not fighting, Kim Ri-an.

606
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,407
Just broken up.

607
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,337
I have nothing
but admiration for you.

608
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,673
That you have
such a passion for education.

609
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,843
The future of our children
is the future of this country.

610
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:57,429
We can't just focus
on growing our business.

611
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:02,434
I believe corporations have an obligation
to create a harmonious society.

612
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,686
And I respect you a great deal too.

613
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:08,607
There are so many far-fetched rumors
surrounding Jaeyul and Jooshin,

614
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:12,110
but you sent Ms. Jae-i to us,
for which I'm very grateful.

615
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:16,948
Well, I'm grateful
you welcomed her.

616
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,701
I'm so sorry I'm late.

617
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,662
-Long time no see.
-Indeed, Chairman Park.

618
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,289
Welcome.

619
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,458
You're as glamorous as ever.

620
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,375
Thank you.

621
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,920
-I trust you're well.
-Yes. You?

622
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,630
It's been far too long.

623
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,155
Over here, Jae-i.

624
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,323
Say hello.

625
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,411
My name is Jung Jae-i.
It's nice to meet you.

626
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,331
Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you, Ms. Jae-i.

627
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,460
Well, seeing such a good-looking
young man and woman together

628
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,254
has got my wheels spinning.

629
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,131
If the two families were to become one,

630
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,716
it would be the union
of Jooshin and Jaeyul.

631
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,719
No one else in Korea
could wield that much power.

632
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:24,599
Is that so? We should consider
our children's desires.

633
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,686
We can't just think about
our business interests.

634
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:30,105
Don't think
it would make a wonderful story?

635
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:33,567
"Two competing corporations become one
through the love of their children."

636
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,235
It is a great story.

637
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:39,281
But what usually makes stories great
is because they're far from reality.

638
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,616
And I know they're rarely ever true.

639
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,995
Maybe not, but I've heard rumors
that make me think, never say never.

640
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:49,875
I heard that Mr. Ri-an and Ms. Jae-i here
are in a relationship already.

641
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,217
That isn't true.

642
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,678
I'm sure it's mere gossip that arose

643
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,806
from two high-profile children
attending the same school.

644
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:05,974
Ri-an, isn't that so?

645
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,480
It's such preposterous gossip.

646
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,150
Above all else, our main intention

647
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:19,196
is to match our son with a family
who shares similar values with Jooshin.

648
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,823
We're committed to upholding traditions
and giving back.

649
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:25,243
Meanwhile,
Jaeyul prioritizes profits overall.

650
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,121
In essence, we have very different goals.

651
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,167
The two corporations
are like night and day.

652
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,378
If growth potential
was your main priority, for example,

653
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,172
there's no reason for the Jaeyul Group

654
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,925
to even consider merging
with a stagnating Jooshin.

655
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,804
It appears I've broached
a sensitive subject. I apologize.

656
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:45,972
Excuse me.

657
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,432
Hope to see you again soon.

658
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:22,717
Ri-an will never let go of Jae-i.
Unlike me, he doesn't get bored.

659
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:26,554
And unlike you, he actually knows
the difference between love and greed.

660
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,600
You're off the rails these days.
I'm worried about you, honestly.

661
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,645
-You still have a thing for me?
-Whoa! What are you--

662
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,772
If not, then just stay out of my business.

663
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,202
It's been a long time.

664
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,246
You remember me, don't you?

665
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,747
Of course. Hello, dear.

666
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:57,377
Well, I have someone who's been waiting
to introduce himself to you,

667
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,545
but he's very shy.

668
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,130
And who's that?

669
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,048
After all, I'm Jae-i's friend.

670
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,677
It's only right to help her out.
Wouldn't you say?

671
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:07,887
Yoon He-ra.

672
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,517
Hmm.

673
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,062
Meet Jae-i's boyfriend.

674
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,278
He's living proof our school motto works.

675
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:26,531
It's noblesse oblige in action.
Carrying on our tradition.

676
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,828
The pride of Jooshin. A scholarship kid.

677
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,389
Don't be shy. Say hello, Kang Ha.
