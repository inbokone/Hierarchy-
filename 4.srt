1
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,961
HIERARCHY

2
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,668
You're crazy.

3
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,253
You're all crazy!

4
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,464
I have to…

5
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,592
I… I'm gonna expose
everything that's going on here!

6
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,587
EPISODE 4

7
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,590
REVENGE, DESIRE, ROMANCE:
THE HEART OF THE MATTER

8
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,135
What about the guard?

9
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,346
I told him I left something behind.
That should buy us ten minutes.

10
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,648
So, what exactly are you looking for?

11
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,899
Drugs.

12
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,778
I saw Choi Yun-seok giving pills
to Kim Ri-an, who hid them in his locker.

13
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:37,949
Ms. Han said it's an antidepressant
like Xanax. I'm sure it's something else.

14
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,701
I've heard about them
dealing drugs before.

15
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,495
Weed, edibles, GHB, stuff like that.

16
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,126
Take a look.

17
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,393
Find anything?

18
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,606
What is it?
Is there something in those photos?

19
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,734
I can't believe it.

20
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,487
I didn't know she could smile like that.

21
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,422
Oh, that's cold!

22
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,803
Okay, you ready? Let's go.

23
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,974
No, wait!

24
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,349
It's so pretty.

25
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,601
Just like you.

26
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,104
Ri-an.

27
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,732
I'm so happy right now.

28
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,902
Usually, I'm so focused
on playing my role…

29
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,365
on how Jung Jae-i of the Jaeyul Group
should be acting.

30
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,118
It's almost etched into my brain.

31
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,914
With you, I don't worry about any of that.

32
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,543
I hear you.

33
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,713
It can feel good to forget who you are,

34
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,091
to forget that I'm Kim Ri-an,
heir to the Jooshin empire.

35
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,265
I like feeling that way with you.

36
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,271
In fact,

37
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,900
I like you more than I thought
it was possible to like anyone.

38
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,187
I see you're on your way home.

39
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,440
We just landed, so I thought
I'd call you from the plane.

40
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,028
Well, Ri-an,
how did you feel about yesterday?

41
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,988
How'd I feel about what?

42
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,698
About the glimpse into your future.

43
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,701
The things that'll be yours,
the people you'll command.

44
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,745
Does it seem more real to you now?

45
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,956
All this love I've prepared
for you to inherit one day?

46
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,042
You call that "love"?

47
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,126
You're right.

48
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,420
That kind of love can be a burden.

49
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,923
Jooshin Group's reputation,

50
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,675
the future of its employees
and their families,

51
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,803
all of that will be on your shoulders.

52
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,972
It's a heavy crown but a valuable one.

53
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,601
You must protect your right
to inherit that crown, Ri-an.

54
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,104
Maintain your aura of nobility.

55
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,398
Don't involve yourself
in any cheap scandals.

56
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,565
Be above it.

57
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,652
Always remind yourself
of how important you are.

58
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,863
I'll talk to you again soon, my successor.

59
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,521
Your tutors are waiting.
Class will begin once you've changed.

60
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,481
Do I at least get a break?

61
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,860
You have strategic management with
Professor Cho of Seoul National University

62
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,612
and international trade
with Professor Son of Harvard.

63
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,615
Essential courses for a future leader
of a top company to master.

64
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,618
These tutors were
meticulously chosen for you.

65
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,372
Besides, you have a commitment at
5:00 a.m. tomorrow. We can't reschedule.

66
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,665
I'm only 18.

67
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,042
I'm still just in high school.

68
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,212
My schedule is packed
from sunrise until after midnight.

69
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,592
I think I deserve some breathing room
when I get home from school, don't you?

70
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,594
I understand that you must be tired,

71
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:50,970
nonetheless…

72
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:01,939
There you are.

73
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,484
Oh, Woo-jin, sometimes your mom
doesn't have a clue.

74
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,196
If I'm trying to run for president,
I'll need Jooshin's heir to support me.

75
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,948
But all we have for him is
some measly seaweed soup?

76
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,992
I'll have you know Ri-an
specifically asked for it.

77
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,621
Ri-an likes seaweed soup.
Thanks a lot, Mom.

78
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,957
-Ah, I think that's our cue to leave.
-Ah!

79
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,502
Sometimes, your mom does have a clue.

80
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,921
-Please enjoy your meal, Ri-an.
-Thank you. I'm sure I will.

81
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,311
It's just seaweed soup.

82
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,897
Why doesn't it taste like this
at my place?

83
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,024
You have the best chefs
in the world on your staff.

84
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,902
-They can make anything you want them to.
-That's not true.

85
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,029
There are some things you can't fake.

86
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,824
The warmth of a home-cooked meal,
for example. Things like that.

87
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,661
You won't be getting that
at my place.

88
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,206
Come over anytime.

89
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,709
-You'd help me be a good son.
-I know my parents would love it.

90
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,254
You're a good friend, man.

91
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,507
I really should come more often.

92
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,430
Something came to me recently.

93
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,060
Being together felt so natural for us.
Jae-i and me.

94
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,729
Time we spent, she and I,

95
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,109
that was the only time
either of us felt anything like comfort.

96
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,822
I guess that's why
I've been feeling so anxious lately.

97
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,407
It's like a part of me is missing.

98
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,370
Can Jae-i really be okay with this?

99
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,289
I know how anxious she gets.

100
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,292
No way.

101
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,252
I know she's hurting.

102
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:48,963
What about you?

103
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,091
Let's eat.

104
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,556
Here.

105
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,862
Right before you pull the trigger,
the target senses it.

106
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,157
They can feel that a bullet
will soon be passing through their body.

107
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,784
What matters next is how they react.

108
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,661
Either they stand clueless and meet death,

109
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,122
or they're swift enough
to live another day.

110
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,334
The look in their eyes at that moment,

111
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,337
in that brief instant
preceding their death or their escape,

112
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,381
is the most
exhilarating thing in the world.

113
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,509
You're right. Every time
I hit something that's trying to run away,

114
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,012
I get this insane rush of adrenaline.

115
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,930
That's why I find hunting enjoyable.

116
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,099
What about you, Jae-i?

117
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,605
Well, I think--

118
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,358
"Oh, that poor thing,
so weak and defenseless."

119
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,735
Something along those lines?

120
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,613
Does that explain the scholarship boy?

121
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,746
Do you feel the same compassion for him
as you do for the game animals

122
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,666
that cower and flee from you
on the hunting grounds?

123
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,588
Because, otherwise,
I can't understand it.

124
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,590
"Scholarship."

125
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,804
Well, I guess
it's like mother, like daughter.

126
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,766
Just something low-class sluts
have in common.

127
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,232
Jae-hyeok?

128
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,359
Yeah, Dad?

129
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,572
Don't ever let me hear you
talk like that again, you brat.

130
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,991
This isn't a subject for you
to babble about like an idiot.

131
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,249
-Get out.
-Yes, sir.

132
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,759
I felt sorry for him.
It was just like you said.

133
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,804
I felt bad for him because
he was a scholarship student.

134
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,765
People at school exaggerated it.

135
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,684
I thought you'd learned your lesson.

136
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,477
You've seen first-hand

137
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,022
where trivial emotions like pity
can lead, haven't you? So why?

138
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,695
What happened
to the last kid wasn't enough?

139
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:28,914
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,213
You've spent enough time there.

141
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,886
Thankfully, the rumors about Jooshin
and Jaeyul being enemies have died down.

142
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,597
You're moving to New York.

143
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,516
Start getting ready.

144
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,994
Noona.

145
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,042
That was annoying.

146
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,503
Dad slapped me again,

147
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,088
and it's your fault.

148
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,800
I think he slapped you because
you don't know how to shut up.

149
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,468
And by the way,

150
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,637
don't call me "noona" ever again.

151
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,389
It makes my skin crawl.

152
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,225
What? Whoa!

153
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:30,851
Does it?

154
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,730
"Skin crawl." Good one.

155
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,691
You sure seem confident, hmm?

156
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,611
Just remember,

157
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,198
noona…

158
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,704
that I still have cards I can play here.

159
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,333
Don't forget what you signed.

160
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,111
Kim Ri-an!

161
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,572
Let's go together.

162
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,242
-What do you want for lunch?
-Well done, Yoon He-ra.

163
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,786
-You might survive this after all.
-What's that again?

164
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,080
Imagine if she tried
to take on Jae-i alone.

165
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,499
We'd be waving "bye"
at her funeral by now.

166
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,417
Mm-hmm.

167
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,878
By sticking next to Ri-an,
she has guaranteed protection.

168
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,421
Ah.

169
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,909
I asked you here to apologize.

170
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,160
My dad…

171
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,413
I'm sure you felt
insulted the other night.

172
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,999
Meet Jae-i's boyfriend.

173
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,294
Nice to meet you, sir. Hi, I'm Kang Ha.

174
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:26,467
What makes you think
you have the right to address me?

175
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,221
Please don't worry about that.
It doesn't affect me at all.

176
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,934
I've had to put up with so much crap
here at Jooshin, I'm immune by now.

177
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,061
But thanks anyway.

178
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,687
Why are you thanking me?

179
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,106
Plenty of people at this school
have done bad things to me,

180
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,192
but not one of them has apologized.

181
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,612
You're the first person to do that, Jae-i.

182
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,660
Well, if it happens again,

183
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,330
don't wait around
expecting another apology.

184
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,539
Don't try to fight.

185
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,833
It's better to just run away.

186
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,379
Jae-i.

187
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,714
Do you still like Kim Ri-an?

188
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,259
What?

189
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,638
If you still do, can I ask what made you
break up with him and run away?

190
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,057
Did something force you to do it?

191
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,226
If you wanna be with him,

192
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,937
what's holding you back?

193
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,108
I thought I already told you.

194
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,360
Remember?

195
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,320
The line we don't cross?

196
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,873
I wanna see your smiling face as well.

197
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,084
So how about it?

198
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,003
Let's date for real and stop faking.

199
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,714
Forget Kim Ri-an.

200
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,757
I'll be the one by your side.

201
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,221
You don't have to be
anxious or lonely anymore.

202
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,143
I'll make you smile. Or try, at least.

203
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,691
You don't have to be
anxious anymore.

204
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,445
I'm here to help.

205
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,572
Jae-i, I'll be by your side.

206
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,285
It's strange.

207
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,495
They're so alike.

208
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,884
Who cares if it's real or fake.
It's all meaningless to me.

209
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,887
-What do you mean?
-You could never understand.

210
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,347
-Why? Because I'm a scholarship student?
-No.

211
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,558
I don't think you and I are any different.

212
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,188
It's just, we both live
in completely different worlds.

213
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,232
In my world, how I feel doesn't matter.

214
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,192
At all!

215
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,278
That's the world I have to survive in.

216
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,364
At least until I can stand on my own.

217
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,659
What do you mean, "survive"?

218
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,411
I told you you wouldn't understand.

219
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,082
I'm gonna pretend you never said that.

220
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,772
Well, Ms. Park?

221
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,233
How do we look?

222
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,694
I will pretend I never saw you.

223
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,867
Oh, and Ri-an?

224
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,456
Your mother was so gracious
to attend our school event the other day.

225
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,999
I hope I made that clear.

226
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,753
Would you pass on how truly thankful I am
for her doing us that honor?

227
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,339
Tell her yourself like you always do.

228
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,300
Right.

229
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,391
I can't tell who's in charge anymore.

230
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,768
Whoever has the most power.

231
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,979
Huh?

232
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,737
Age, gender,

233
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,990
job title… none of it matters.

234
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,701
These days, power is
the only thing that counts.

235
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,452
You must have figured that out by now.

236
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,997
Missed a button, Ms. Han.

237
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,879
Okay. Come to the lounge.

238
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,005
Don't forget to eat lunch.

239
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,549
I'm meeting my friends.

240
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,677
You don't really love me…

241
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,723
do you Woo-jin?

242
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,562
Jealous?

243
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,398
But I'm not sure of who.

244
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,818
Or maybe…

245
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,488
you're the one in love.

246
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,660
Who is she?

247
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,038
The woman in Lee Woo-jin's heart?

248
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,726
I'll see you at the studio.

249
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,192
-Good afternoon.
-Hi, Ms. Han.

250
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,235
Mm-hmm.

251
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,945
Hey, did you see her bag?

252
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,489
-Yes, you are.
-Hello.

253
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,409
-It's a secret.
-You are, right? Right? Right?

254
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,625
Jae-i?

255
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,673
Normally, we apologize to someone
after bumping into them by accident.

256
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,260
"Teachers and students are expected
to show mutual respect."

257
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,262
Section 8 of the school regulations.

258
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,388
Respect you?

259
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,640
Do I have to?

260
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,434
Perhaps I should be recommending you
for special counseling now.

261
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,061
"Counseling"?

262
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,314
I don't remember you
having this attitude before.

263
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,734
Plus, you and Kang Ha have been
hanging out an awful lot lately.

264
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,571
You're so on edge. It's almost as if
you think you're in danger.

265
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,577
Come by to see me anytime
if you need some help.

266
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,747
We've all been through so much lately,

267
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:34,543
and we can't let a tragedy
like that ever happen again.

268
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,339
An Hermès Birkin bag?

269
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,385
You know what, Ms. Han?
I think you're the one who's in danger.

270
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,113
Ju-won, what were you
doing in there alone?

271
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,199
I left my house key at home, so--

272
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,952
The passcode is enough
to unlock it, you know that.

273
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:10,829
Right.

274
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,374
I'm, uh, late for study hall.
I'll get going.

275
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,342
Here's how you get

276
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,719
the numerical value
of the average rate of change.

277
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,930
The increase in X is A minus B.

278
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,557
That gives you delta X.

279
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,558
Thanks.

280
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,727
I'll try solving it from here.

281
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,774
Tae-ho, you lived in the States
before coming here, right?

282
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:40,859
Yeah.

283
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,736
So you wouldn't have any friends in Korea.

284
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,905
Mm, you could say that.

285
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,075
UNIVERSITY OF MANNHEIM

286
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,327
Mannheim?

287
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,621
Not the UK or America?

288
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,458
Everyone is going to the UK or America.
I wanted to go somewhere quiet.

289
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,419
Somewhere without any
Jooshin kids, you mean?

290
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,505
Well, not necessarily.

291
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,673
You're different from the others,
aren't you, Tae-ho?

292
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,592
I am?

293
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,302
You're the heir to Jaeyul Hotels,

294
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,388
yet you interact
with the students like me.

295
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,306
And the new kid…

296
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,186
Kang Ha is your friend.

297
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,270
Who says that?

298
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,359
I mean, who says I'm friends
with that scholarship asshole?

299
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,861
I saw you and Kang Ha
eating a burger together.

300
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,697
Wh…what are you saying?

301
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,032
Don't worry.

302
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,283
You know I'm discreet.

303
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:31,910
I won't tell.

304
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,998
Speaking of Kang Ha…

305
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,503
don't you think he looks a lot like
the kid who died?

306
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,659
Hey. Are you crazy?

307
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,578
Are you fucking stupid, asshole?

308
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,955
What the fuck were you doing
with Jae-i, huh?

309
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:17,914
Huh?

310
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,959
Answer me.
What's this asshole's name again?

311
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,169
Kang In-han?

312
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,255
You must think you're tough, huh?
You son of a bitch.

313
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,548
You stupid asshole.

314
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,383
Little shit!

315
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:29,926
Hey.

316
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,512
Get up!

317
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,961
You scholarship kids
are always hiding in the ugliest places.

318
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,176
You should be thanking me,
don't you think?

319
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,469
Thanking you?

320
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,722
Even the elite of the elite find it hard
to make eye contact with Jae-i's father.

321
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:20,894
And thanks to me, you were introduced.
That's quite an accomplishment for you.

322
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,897
You only did that
to put Jae-i on the spot.

323
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,317
You should be apologizing
to her and me. Honestly.

324
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,944
You should be apologizing to her.

325
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,405
If you think about it,
you're the one who put Jae-i on the spot.

326
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,074
Just by being around her.

327
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,830
Would you like to hear a story?

328
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,877
Honey, there was a kid here
before that was just like you.

329
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,879
He was close with Jae-i too.

330
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,383
Have you heard the rest of it yet?

331
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,511
I'm sure you have.

332
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,849
You mean the scholarship kid
Kim Ri-an killed?

333
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:00,809
Ri-an?

334
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,602
Ri-an is Jooshin's heir.

335
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,272
Why would he bother
with a mere scholarship kid?

336
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:14,447
If you're really looking for someone
to blame, I'd say it was actually

337
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,534
Jae-i who was behind it.

338
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,331
Jae-i was behind it?

339
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,417
Whatever sympathy
Jae-i tried to show him,

340
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,085
he never should've accepted it.

341
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:31,798
If he hadn't, that tragic accident
may never have happened.

342
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,849
Jae-i's the one… who killed him.

343
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,856
Don't think this has
nothing to do with you.

344
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,733
You'll be exactly the same.

345
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,403
Whenever a scholarship kid
gets mixed up with us, there are issues.

346
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:56,364
In the end, no matter
how bad the consequences get,

347
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,617
they never seem to reach us.

348
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,869
It's people like you who suffer.

349
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,837
And why are you telling me this now?

350
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,631
Concern?

351
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,174
For everyone's sake.

352
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,968
Nobody wants to see
another tragedy happen.

353
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,676
Whoo!

354
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,561
No, seriously.
I have to go shopping today.

355
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,522
I got my personal
color analysis yesterday.

356
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,357
-Oh yeah?
-Guess what I got.

357
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,025
-Summer?
-Not cool winter?

358
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,527
-Right. It's summer.
-Smell.

359
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,946
-I need to get new makeup.
-Nice, right?

360
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,162
We have a time limit now?

361
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,834
You're being exiled to New York?

362
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,879
I wanted to have some more fun,
but I guess we won't have time.

363
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:59,506
HAHA

364
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,595
HAHA

365
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,615
Jae-i.

366
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,826
What's wrong? What's going on?

367
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,537
Jung Jae-i!

368
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,540
Leave her alone.

369
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,042
Don't you get it? This is all your fault!

370
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,460
How is this my fault?

371
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,505
She's always been anxious.

372
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,215
But now, her father knows

373
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,093
there's a scholarship student
sniffing around his daughter.

374
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,511
Think about that.

375
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,430
Think about the pressure
she's under, thanks to you.

376
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,599
Do you have any idea
what that's doing to her?

377
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,435
Do you have any idea what we
have to deal with every single day?

378
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,565
Of course not. How could you understand?

379
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,194
I'm so sick of you
tryhard scholarship pricks.

380
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,993
This must be how he looked at In-han

381
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,453
right before he killed him.

382
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,168
Listen to me.

383
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,504
I consider you a threat to Jae-i's safety.

384
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,214
Your kind always is.

385
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,217
Always.

386
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,430
Whoa, whoa!

387
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,266
Ri-an, Ri-an! You don't need to
waste your time with this prick.

388
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,851
We'll deal with it, okay?

389
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,853
-We'll deal with it.
-Let's go.

390
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,190
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Come here.

391
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,653
Man, you guys are terrifying.

392
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,197
I'm not about to
wind up dead somewhere, am I?

393
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:52,076
You know, like the other
scholarship kid you killed.

394
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,465
Wow, look at your faces.

395
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,637
Did I hit a nerve? Am I not supposed to
bring that up in front of Kim Ri-an?

396
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,188
Kang Ha.

397
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:24,984
Who are you?

398
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,209
Parade, riposte. Touche.

399
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,128
Prêts.

400
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,588
Allez.

401
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,305
Prêts.

402
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:55,890
Allez.

403
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,687
Attaque, touche, point.

404
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,230
Prêts. Allez.

405
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,114
Attaque, touche, point.

406
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:20,999
Thanks.

407
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,924
Can you do a background check for me
on the new kid?

408
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,384
Why all of a sudden?

409
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,511
From the moment he got to Jooshin,

410
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,556
all that scholarship kid can talk about
is how he doesn't want any trouble.

411
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,225
But he still comes after me
every chance he can get.

412
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,602
Like he has nothing to be afraid of.

413
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,022
I think you're right about that.

414
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,567
Nobody would act like that unless
they thought they had a good reason.

415
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,821
I'm suddenly curious about what that is.

416
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,998
You want an apology.

417
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,542
But you won't get one.

418
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,545
I don't want your apology.
It wouldn't mean anything anyway.

419
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,301
What happened with the thing I asked you?

420
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,555
After everything, you only care
if your chore gets done?

421
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,224
It's someone at school.

422
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,145
Whoever sent you those messages
sent them from Jooshin High.

423
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,939
I hope you're happy

424
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,400
because that's the last favor
I ever do for you.

425
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:30,985
From now on,

426
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,863
we're no longer friends.

427
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,033
You never thought of me
as a friend anyway.

428
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,620
Face it. We've burned our last bridge.

429
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,582
What's the point of hanging out
and pretending everything's all right?

430
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:46,959
You done?

431
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,298
Since we're not friends,
I'll just come out and say it.

432
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,508
I like Ri-an.

433
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,593
God, I didn't wanna say this.

434
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:59,055
It's so childish and cliché,
but I l liked him first!

435
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,308
Way before you. Since kindergarten.

436
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,478
I've been holding back and letting you
have him because we were best friends.

437
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,395
But that's all over.

438
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,150
From now on…

439
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,278
Ri-an is mine.

440
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,161
Go ahead.

441
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,706
He's all yours.

442
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,043
It's better this way.

443
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,797
Are you disappointed?

444
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,342
What? Were you expecting me
to slap you across the face?

445
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,473
Don't get me wrong.

446
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,767
I'm mad enough
to do a lot worse than that.

447
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,646
But like you said,
we're not friends anymore.

448
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,861
Fighting, getting angry…

449
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,446
What would even be the point?

450
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,507
Jae-i,
on the count of three,

451
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,800
let's jump in together!

452
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,677
Okay, He-ra.

453
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,597
One, two, three!

454
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,483
-He-ra.
-Jae-i.

455
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,744
Hey, wait. I'm gonna take a video.

456
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,917
We didn't take a picture of this yet.
Cheese!

457
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,575
What's wrong with me?
Why am I crying?

458
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,455
Please. He-ra is supposed to
graduate next year.

459
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,998
Can't anything be done?

460
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,710
I could send her abroad
to study with your second child.

461
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,463
I remember he always liked He-ra,
didn't he?

462
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,925
The whole company is about to collapse.

463
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:44,679
I know you have the connections
to get us with Jooshin. Please, Mr. Kim!

464
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,350
It's about survival now,
Yoon He-ra.

465
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,811
Snap out of it.

466
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,369
You'll see a lot of the chairman's son
when you move to New York.

467
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,329
Have you ever met him before?

468
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:14,041
I haven't. I've heard about him,
but we've never spoken.

469
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,336
We planned tonight's dinner
so you two could get acquainted.

470
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,299
But I also plan to discuss Jaeyul Group's
electric car issues with Chairman Park.

471
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,801
You know what you should do.

472
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:27,054
It's a big night for us,
so don't mess it up, okay?

473
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:27,972
Okay.

474
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,776
There's something
I need to check.

475
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,904
Can you get the scholarship kid's
student record for me?

476
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,378
All right.
I'll have it ready for you.

477
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,845
There was nothing special about him.

478
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,057
Yeah. You're right.

479
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:15,102
But I still can't shake the feeling
that something isn't right.

480
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,104
He's just a scholarship student.

481
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,231
I mean, why do you care so much?

482
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,444
Good question.

483
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,614
Why does he bother me so much?

484
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,708
So an anonymous account
just sent you this video and nothing else?

485
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,711
Yeah. Who could it be?

486
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,672
Whoever sent it to me
knows who my brother is.

487
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,761
Yoon He-ra said she thinks
In-han's accident was Jae-i's fault,

488
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:49,678
not Kim Ri-an's.

489
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,556
She said that? Why now, all of a sudden?

490
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,894
Well, she's not exactly wrong.
They were basically all accomplices.

491
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:57,853
No way.

492
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,022
The Jae-i I know is different.

493
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,524
In what way?

494
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,151
She isn't mean and selfish
like Kim Ri-an and Yoon He-ra.

495
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,208
These two make
a great-looking pair, don't you think?

496
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,629
I guess this is what people mean
when they say, "a match made in heaven."

497
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,299
My dear, I'm sorry for the other night.

498
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,844
I was mistaken about Ri-an,
and I apologize.

499
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,513
It's alright, really.

500
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,516
You know how these rumors start.
It wasn't worthy of your concern.

501
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,102
I hope you'll understand, Mr. Seon-jun.

502
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,937
Oh please. There's nothing to discuss.

503
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,565
With friendships between
people of our caliber,

504
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,358
there's always bound to be talk.

505
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,776
I don't pay it any mind.

506
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,988
I can see you're destined
for great things.

507
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,949
Rest assured,
when Jae-i comes to New York,

508
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,659
I'll take excellent care of her.

509
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,287
We should get engaged
right after you graduate,

510
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,330
then attend university together.

511
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,250
Whose son is this?

512
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,420
I've never seen him
rush into anything so fast before.

513
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,631
Well, if we're going to do it,
what's the point of waiting?

514
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,719
Besides, there's only so many families
that make a suitable match.

515
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,847
Honestly, I was just hoping
to find somebody pretty.

516
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,475
And she's more than that. She's perfect.

517
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,768
I should claim her while I can.

518
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,981
I was worried that
they might not get along.

519
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,066
I see my concern was misplaced.

520
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,277
Please enjoy. Eat up, Jae-i.

521
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,614
Thanks.

522
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,465
Jae-i?

523
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,635
I meant what I said earlier during dinner.

524
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,430
I'm aware for people like us,
marriage can feel…

525
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,057
Remember this?

526
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,852
Our lives will be
suffocating enough when we're married.

527
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:02,895
JJJ_J_00
HAS SENT A PHOTO

528
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:06,106
-Does Kim Ri-an know?
-I get it. Really.

529
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,319
Do you like dogs?
I have a lot of them in New York.

530
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,959
Maybe I should be asking
if Ri-an is involved at all.

531
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,727
Jae-i?

532
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,567
I like you more than I thought
it was possible to like anyone.

533
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,112
You don't have to be anxious anymore.
I'll make you smile.

534
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,488
I'll be by your side.

535
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,450
Ugh! What the fuck?

536
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,535
You psycho!

537
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,870
Jesus.

538
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,582
Oh shit.

539
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,722
Out of all of
Shakespeare's sonnets,

540
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,348
this is the most famous.

541
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,683
"Sonnet 18."

542
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,019
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"

543
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,146
Published for the first time in 1609.

544
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,899
As you all know,
Shakespeare lived 400 years ago.

545
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:35,613
As such, there are many archaic phrases
from that time seen in this poem too.

546
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:40,784
The poem was written in iambic pentameter,
which means ten syllables in…

547
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:35,756
Hello.

548
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,675
Better keep your promise
about that date.

549
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,718
Of course. You know me.

550
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,220
Now move it.

551
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,147
I came
because Seon-u asked me.

552
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,943
But I have no idea
what you'd wanna see me for.

553
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,321
I thought… we could become friends.

554
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,826
But… but you hardly
know me at all.

555
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,327
Of course I do!

556
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,204
At the very least,

557
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,374
I know how much
you hate your older sister.

558
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,258
Oh.

559
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,683
I'm having a party. Wanna come?
Bring Si-u if you can.

560
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,852
-Just ask him yourself.
-You ask him!

561
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:41,405
Why hasn't Jae-i been in school?
Why isn't she answering my calls?

562
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,950
Did you forget how to talk?

563
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,535
I'm asking you what's going on.

564
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,078
Whatever it is, it's her business.

565
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,832
I don't see any reason
to tell you a thing.

566
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,254
You don't know either, do you?

567
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,396
-She's been banished.
-She what?

568
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,191
There was a dinner for Seon-jun's family
of the Gongseong Group.

569
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,109
I don't know what she said there,

570
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,736
but she must've ruined it.

571
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,113
And so Jae-i's enraged father
must have said,

572
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,657
"Forget school or anything else,
and get her out of my sight."

573
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,451
She's at their vacation house.

574
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,162
And when she's unbanished?
She'll be sent to New York City.

575
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,371
New York?

576
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,831
Just like that?

577
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,667
Hey, don't you dare go
and tell Ri-an where Jae-i went.

578
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,795
I'm on fire right now.

579
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,421
Get in my way, and I'll destroy you.

580
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,840
"Get in your way"?
What are you plotting now?

581
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,098
How do I look?

582
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,141
Pretty?

583
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,768
I… I… I'm sorry?

584
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:54,937
What are you doing?

585
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,001
I must be pretty today.

586
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,503
That reaction is all I need.

587
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,047
Thanks for the confirmation, Woo-jin.

588
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:48,490
KIM RI-AN

589
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,680
RECENT CALLS

590
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,223
JAE-I

591
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:18,020
186 Biseong-ro.
That's Jae-i's vacation house address.

592
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,771
Apparently, she's been banished there.

593
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,232
Don't you think her boyfriend
should be there for her?

594
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,434
SLIDE TO ANSWER

595
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,138
Jae-i.

596
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,558
What are you doing here?

597
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:55,450
I was worried. I couldn't reach you,
and you weren't even in school.

598
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,869
What are you doing here?

599
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:03,500
Tell me what's going on.
Tell me what I can do to help you.

600
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,548
Go.

601
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,259
You can't help with anything.

602
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,052
No, I can help.

603
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,889
Whatever it is, it's better
than going through it alone.

604
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:25,397
Why do you keep pushing me away?
You look like you're about to collapse.

605
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,816
I can tell how much pain you're in.

606
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:31,111
How do you expect to survive
if you keep shutting me out?

607
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,157
Let go.

608
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:36,575
No way.

609
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:40,120
No matter what happens,
I'll stay by your side.

610
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,084
Please just leave me alone!

611
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,087
What can you do for me?

612
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,467
I'm being blackmailed,
and I don't even know who's behind it.

613
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,764
So tell me.

614
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,933
What could you possibly do to help?

615
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,064
Blackmailed?

616
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,193
By who?

617
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,071
And for what?

618
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,114
What could you be blackmailed over?

619
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,744
I killed someone.

620
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,211
What?

621
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,510
I said I killed someone.

622
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:46,937
Kim Ri-an.

623
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,733
This is a surprise. Why are you here?

624
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,152
I have something to say.

625
00:51:57,072 --> 00:52:00,450
I've thought it over, and this is
the only card I have left to play.

626
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,577
Although, just saying it
isn't really my style.

627
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:03,578
What card?

628
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,416
Jae-i's off to New York
with Park Seon-jun.

629
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,963
Which means that ship has sailed.

630
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,299
She's at her vacation home. She's gonna
stay there until her move to New York.

631
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:22,472
So listen carefully
to what I have to say, Kim Ri-an.

632
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,976
It's over between you and her.
You can't stop her from leaving.

633
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,856
Start a new life with me.

634
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,820
I like you, Ri-an.

635
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,406
More than that, I love you.
I have for a long time.

636
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,533
So why don't we make it official?

637
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,005
Jae-i.

638
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,008
You said she's at her vacation house?

639
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,641
KANG IN-HAN, KANG HA
FRATERNAL TWIN BROTHERS

640
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,272
You killed someone?

641
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:14,858
Who?

642
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,695
A scholarship kid.

643
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,240
Kang In-han.

644
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,298
He was…

645
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,013
my brother.

646
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,359
The person you just said you killed…

647
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:01,821
was my brother.
