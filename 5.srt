1
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,961
HIERARCHY

2
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,214
He was…

3
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:54,971
…my brother.

4
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,187
The person you just said you killed…

5
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,524
was my brother.

6
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,335
You stupid
fucking scholarship kids.

7
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,630
Wait, he hit Ri-an?

8
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,381
Oh yeah. He's dead, for sure.

9
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,050
Are you insane, dude?

10
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,760
You good? You all right?

11
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:34,928
He must be insane.

12
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,722
Ri-an looks pissed.

13
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,272
You nuts, douchebag?
Throwing that ball at Ri-an.

14
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,442
It rolled over here.
So I figured I'd throw it back.

15
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,445
I didn't know that it would hit him.
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,822
Are you blind, dude?

17
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,824
Are you mental?

18
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:59,661
'Cause if the ball rolled towards you,
you should've brought it over here.

19
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,497
You don't ever throw it at Ri-an, okay?

20
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,963
Are you glaring at me?

21
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,590
You should be begging all day,
and you're glaring?

22
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,762
Who the hell
do you think you are?

23
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,848
-Acting up? Piece of shit!
-How dare you!

24
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,392
-Can't stand you, son of a bitch!
-You're a scholarship student!

25
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,727
-Act like one, damn it!
-Stop it!

26
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,479
Little bitch!

27
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,273
You little--

28
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,233
Crazy fucker!

29
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,527
-What are you waiting for?
-Get him!

30
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,112
Out of the way, idiot!

31
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,619
Over there! Get that asshole!

32
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,454
Run faster, douchebags!

33
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,665
Hey, over there. That way, that way!

34
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,182
Every last dime you were gonna inherit.

35
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,058
You're gonna hand it over.

36
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:09,189
This has actually been
way overdue for quite a while now.

37
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,358
You should've been kicked out
with your mother.

38
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,568
And so,

39
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:18,114
really, I'm just trying to recover
what was rightfully mine all along.

40
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,532
Why?

41
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,701
Because you don't deserve
any of it.

42
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,120
You're not worthy.

43
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,210
Sign the papers and get it notarized.

44
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,629
That's all I want, really.

45
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,547
How could you do such a thing?

46
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,342
Well, if you have a problem with it,

47
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,470
I'll go to Dad
and show him your little video.

48
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,267
-Jeong Jae-hyeok!
-I'm sure Dad would love it, wouldn't he?

49
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,612
You should think it over.

50
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,615
Let me know what you decide.

51
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,450
Keep the phone.

52
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,161
I have backups.

53
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,285
Do you, uh, want this?

54
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,330
When you're having a bad day,
candy makes it easier.

55
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,912
Here, have one.

56
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:38,087
You guys are quite similar,
don't you think?

57
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,720
Huh?

58
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,318
The person you just said you killed

59
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,487
was my brother.

60
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,036
You…

61
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,664
lied about who you were.

62
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,542
'Cause I had to find out
what exactly happened here.

63
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,503
What my brother endured at Jooshin High.

64
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,254
Why they covered it up.

65
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,256
Why the school was so obsessed,

66
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,009
trying to keep it so quiet.

67
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:31,516
Jae-i, my brother wasn't killed
in a simple hit-and-run.

68
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,142
There's gotta be a reason.

69
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,311
In-han was in the street.

70
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,854
The night of the accident.

71
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,857
So that's what you really wanted.

72
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,901
More information.

73
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:42,944
That's right.

74
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,615
At first, I did, but not now.

75
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,618
When I first came here, I was thinking
that it could've been anyone.

76
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,454
"Who bullied my brother,
and who killed him?" I really had to know.

77
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,583
But in search for my answers,
and as I spent more time with you,

78
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,836
I got to know the real Jae-i.

79
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,632
When I said I wanted to make you smile
and be by your side,

80
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,300
I meant every last word.

81
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,512
But don't forget…

82
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,599
he was my family.

83
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,104
I need to find out how my one
and only brother was killed.

84
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,275
So, Jae-i, I…

85
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,157
…I need your help.

86
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,912
Jae-i.

87
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,208
Jae-i!

88
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,642
You lay a finger on her again,
and I'll break it.

89
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,811
You're brothers? You and In-han?

90
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,564
Yeah. Now it's all coming together.

91
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:05,485
Now I can see why you kept bothering me
and why you approached Jae-i.

92
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,863
What? Did you want revenge?

93
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,657
So you did something…

94
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,537
that would deserve it, Kim Ri-an.

95
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,839
What?

96
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,342
What do you want?

97
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,803
To end up like your brother?

98
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,764
My what?

99
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,582
-Lower your damn hands!
-Damn scholarship kid!

100
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,043
Move your hands,
or I'll move 'em for you! Come on!

101
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,088
He deserves way more
than the ass-kicking we're giving him!

102
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,844
Did that hurt?

103
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,722
All right, come on. Get up.

104
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,687
What the hell?
Jeez, you ruined the shot!

105
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,480
-Come on.
-In-han!

106
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,837
Stop it.

107
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,763
THE LATE KANG IN-HAN

108
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,271
Stop it.

109
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,523
Stop!

110
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,651
I said, stop!

111
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,740
Please. I just…

112
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,869
…I just want you to stop.

113
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,250
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

114
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,960
I shouldn't have left you alone.

115
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,922
I should've been here.
Here, right by your side.

116
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,090
I'm sorry.

117
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,942
EPISODE 5
OUTSTANDING OUTSIDERS: THE KANGS

118
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,250
FROM KANG HA

119
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,169
KANG IN-HAN

120
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,215
I wish you were here…

121
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,260
to help me understand what's…

122
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:20,888
what's going on.

123
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,321
So you're saying Kang Ha is
Kang In-han's younger brother?

124
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,865
Apparently, they're twins.
Yeah, fraternal.

125
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,701
-They were twin brothers?
-Yep.

126
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:42,702
'Cause they were twins,

127
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,579
Kang Ha was adopted by his
childless uncle and lived with him,

128
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,289
which is how it went
over the school's head

129
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,750
'cause they lived
at completely different addresses.

130
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,919
Adopted by his uncle?

131
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,255
I thought stuff like that
only happened on TV.

132
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,506
Between us,

133
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,843
isn't it weird that
Kang In-han's brother came here?

134
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,971
He kept acting clueless
and getting on Ri-an's last nerve.

135
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,683
He also got closer to Jae-i, right?

136
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:06,851
He's up to something.

137
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,935
Think so?

138
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,272
Maybe he suspected something was up.

139
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:16,152
The accident that day was very bizarre.
A lot of weirdness there.

140
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,833
Go ahead, Ms. Han.

141
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,921
With your current grades,
Hanguk High School has agreed

142
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,383
to give you a full scholarship
and monetary support until graduation.

143
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:40,926
At Daehan High School,

144
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,803
students who graduate
at the top of their class

145
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,764
get complete college tuition.

146
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,687
A school scholarship.

147
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,522
Sorry, but I already
have all of these perks.

148
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,984
Graduating top of class here
has more benefits.

149
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,903
I worked my butt off to come to Jooshin.

150
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,615
Kang Ha, the school cannot stand by

151
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,951
and allow one single student
to disrupt the study environment.

152
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,913
Our duty is to look after
the mental health of our students.

153
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,998
A duty we take quite seriously.

154
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,251
And in what way am I negatively affecting
their mental health, exactly?

155
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,592
Every time they look at you,

156
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,178
they won't be able to see
anything else but In-han.

157
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,265
You would only serve to be
a constant reminder of their trauma.

158
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,352
Bringing up In-han is taboo.

159
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:35,898
Trauma?

160
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:39,860
"Taboo"?

161
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,322
If you won't transfer, we'll expel you.
It would be easy to justify.

162
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,492
Scholarship students
are outsiders here at Jooshin.

163
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,577
So getting rid of one outsider…

164
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,704
Well, no one would bat an eye.

165
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,918
The choice is yours.

166
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,711
Transfer or expulsion.

167
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,186
I don't want either.

168
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:20,609
You see, I'm gonna prove myself by being
the first to graduate with top grades

169
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,320
as a scholarship recipient.

170
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,155
And I'll show these guys

171
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,950
what is truly fair
and prove that they're not special.

172
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,580
And I'll show them what's right and wrong.

173
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,377
Someone has to.

174
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,463
Because not a single adult here

175
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,425
is teaching them that.

176
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,010
Kang Ha.

177
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,097
Scholarship student Kang Ha
of Class Two, Year Two.

178
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,558
Please process his expulsion, Ms. Han.

179
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,939
The reasoning? A disruptive student
who threatens the school's well-being.

180
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,525
Try it.

181
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,501
It would be easy to justify.

182
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,254
Scholarship students
are outsiders here at Jooshin.

183
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,298
So getting rid of one outsider…

184
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,675
Well, no one would bat an eye.

185
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,093
If you can, I mean.

186
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,519
Jeez.
I can't believe this is happening.

187
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,105
That scholarship dick
really pisses me off.

188
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,566
You should've taken care of him
when I told you to.

189
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,401
I mean, you know I wanted to.

190
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,030
But, you know, Jae-i was acting weird.

191
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,577
Well, she won't be involved from now on.

192
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,372
So make sure you finish the job.

193
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,707
For real? I'd be happy to.

194
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,125
Makes my job way easier.

195
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,503
I've been noticing he's been making

196
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,588
the other scholarship students
get ballsier.

197
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,799
We'll put them in their place.

198
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,011
She couldn't even stand up?

199
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,096
No.

200
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,056
I've never seen her like that.

201
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,767
Her face.
She looked so scared and helpless.

202
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,062
Don't you think there's a reason for it?

203
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,106
"A reason"?

204
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,608
For Jae-i suddenly leaving the country.

205
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,863
For why she broke up with you
and pushed you away.

206
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,575
There has to be a reason for it.

207
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,203
Well, it doesn't really matter why.

208
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,455
I'm only focused on one thing from now on.

209
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,707
Protecting her.

210
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,001
I'm never gonna abandon her.

211
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,460
I'll stay by her side.

212
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,670
What about He-ra?

213
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,175
She asked you to be her boyfriend.

214
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,806
She has you.

215
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,268
I can be her friend, and you can be more.

216
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,814
I think that's a pretty good deal,
don't you?

217
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,461
The two of us getting married,

218
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:30,382
it's something I think will benefit both
the Jaeyul Group and the Gongseong Group.

219
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,178
It's not a bad idea. Mm.

220
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,894
Not much longer till we leave.
Are you making it count?

221
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,356
Yes. You could say that.

222
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,111
Still won't carry a conversation.

223
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,780
You'll need to get used to it.

224
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,741
I mean… considering

225
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,118
when we get to New York,

226
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,703
we'll be seeing a lot of each other.

227
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,501
I'm getting out.

228
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,800
See you at the airport.

229
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,569
Why are you here, Ri-an?

230
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,655
Let's walk together.

231
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,869
So do you feel a little better?

232
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:42,955
I do.

233
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,125
From now on,
don't go anywhere without security.

234
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,626
Especially at school.

235
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,628
Don't leave my side for even a moment.

236
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,672
Why? You worried Kang Ha will kill me?

237
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,300
We have no idea…
what kids like that are capable of.

238
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,677
"Kids like that"?

239
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,138
Don't talk about him that way.

240
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,683
You know scholarship students aren't
any different than the rest of us.

241
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,936
Have you really not learned anything?

242
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,569
You saw I was with Seon-jun.

243
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,362
We're leaving for New York together.

244
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,657
I barely got permission
to go to school until I leave.

245
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,244
So don't visit or call out of the blue
like this and mess it up for me.

246
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,163
I don't want any more trouble.

247
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,415
I can't. I won't let you go, Jae-i.

248
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,834
Did you forget? We're not a thing.

249
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,503
I broke up with you.
I don't know why that's not clear to you.

250
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,756
Even if I were to stay,

251
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,176
we're not getting back together.

252
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,011
Can you at least tell me why?

253
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,556
When we're together,

254
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,893
everything we touch gets destroyed.

255
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,188
I don't know
if it's your fault or mine anymore.

256
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:53,066
At this rate, we'll drag each other down
and mess the other up.

257
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,319
And I'm so tired of hurting people.

258
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,239
So just stop it.

259
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,658
No. I won't accept it.

260
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,826
These people?

261
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,913
I don't care what happens to others.

262
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,916
Protecting you is all that matters to me.

263
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,543
Kim Ri-an.

264
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,005
I thought about it nonstop
while we were separated.

265
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,383
Is it even possible for us to stay away?

266
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,638
The answer? Of course not.

267
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,184
So I've concluded…
I need to keep you by my side

268
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,228
through thick and thin,

269
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,812
no matter where it takes us.

270
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,939
I don't care,

271
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,066
even at the end of the world.

272
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,569
I'd rather spend it by your side.

273
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,740
This is way more than "like."

274
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,911
This is "love"

275
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:48,956
Jung Jae-i, I…

276
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,917
I love you.

277
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,461
Well, I don't.

278
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,421
I don't feel the same way.

279
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,607
Wait.
Why are you telling me that now?

280
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,985
Well, I was young back then.

281
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,611
Oh my God! You're ridiculous!

282
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,363
I saw that
you couldn't find it.

283
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,532
-But hey, it worked out for me.
-Oh, honestly!

284
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,203
I swear, I'm telling you!

285
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,128
That's hilarious.

286
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,592
Hey, Jung Jae-i!

287
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,681
Gosh.

288
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,434
I was so worried
when I heard you passed out.

289
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,602
Are you feeling better now?

290
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,980
I was surprised
when I heard you were leaving.

291
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,440
It was all so sudden.

292
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,276
Wow.

293
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,445
What a beautiful friendship. Really.

294
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,574
All right, you two, have a good time now.

295
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,825
See you, He-ra.

296
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,709
What are you doing here?

297
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,337
Delivering… an invitation.

298
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,591
We're still seen as best friends
by the public.

299
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,218
So I should at least
throw you a farewell party.

300
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,763
"Farewell"?

301
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,973
Sure it's not a celebration?

302
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,601
Well, I guess
it could be a celebration, yeah.

303
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,940
Depending on Ri-an's answer.
I told him… how I felt.

304
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,193
Congrats. I hope that works out for you.

305
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,486
Are we done here?

306
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,364
Don't get in between us.

307
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:47,908
What?

308
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,578
I'm saying don't rile him up
or get him confused.

309
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,996
I'm not even asking for your help.

310
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,415
I just want you to
stay out of my way, okay?

311
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,794
You can do that until you fly out, right?

312
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:03,090
And… you should,
even if you don't want to.

313
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,842
If you don't,
I might have to cause trouble.

314
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,386
What kind of trouble?

315
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,641
I do have something
I can give you that you might like.

316
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,142
How do I put it?

317
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,646
This is something…
that would give you the upper hand.

318
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,232
Now, what on earth
could give me the upper hand?

319
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,483
Call me intrigued.

320
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,944
You'll probably be shocked
when you find out.

321
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,073
Hmm.

322
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,866
But, you know, um,

323
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,035
if I give that to you…

324
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,748
what do I get in return?

325
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,629
No idea. Yeah, I don't know just yet.

326
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,757
But whatever it is,
I'll make sure it's worth your while.

327
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,344
Whenever you want,

328
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,638
however you want it.

329
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,436
I'm going to do whatever it takes.

330
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,728
I'm not bluffing.

331
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,897
I will literally do whatever it takes,

332
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:04,234
whether you, Ri-an,
or all of us get hurt. I don't care.

333
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,120
I forgot to tell you something funny.

334
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,832
The day we ended our friendship…

335
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,418
Well, on the way home, I cried.

336
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,339
I guess we really were friends deep down.

337
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:32,512
So, even though our friendship is over,
I hope we can end it on good terms.

338
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,974
Just leave quietly with your dignity

339
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,768
so this doesn't get messy.

340
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,437
Understand me?

341
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:44,774
See you at the party.

342
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,360
Yoon He-ra.

343
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,294
I wish you well.

344
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:17,057
Would that be enough… to give you closure?

345
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,144
The day of your party
is the day I fly out.

346
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,939
Enjoy your celebration.

347
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,732
I'll get out of your way.

348
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,284
"Enjoy your celebration"?

349
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,621
She always has to have
the last word, doesn't she?

350
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,290
You never know.
It might've been a sincere goodbye.

351
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,960
She wasn't being sincere.
She was taunting me.

352
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,337
Basically saying, "Have fun without me."

353
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,338
I can't stand her.

354
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,550
Well then,
I guess I'll teach her a lesson.

355
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,552
How dare she annoy my darling He-ra.

356
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,886
Huh?

357
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,056
Hey, Dad.

358
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,645
Listen. I want this party
to be the best party ever.

359
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:08,191
Right down to location, DJ, my jewelry.
Everything perfect and beautiful.

360
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,240
All right. Tell you what.
I'll get Mr. Park on the line, okay?

361
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,616
Are you serious?

362
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,412
You're my favorite.
What would I do without you?

363
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,344
Tae-ho.

364
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,434
This is fucking insane.
You gotta be kidding me.

365
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,732
This guy's really the oldest son
of the owners of Jaeyul Hotel?

366
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,359
Is your mother really a prostitute?

367
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,820
You're a bastard?

368
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,864
He even lied
about living in the States.

369
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,449
His dad abandoned him.

370
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,450
He had nothing.

371
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,577
He went to the same school
as the Kang brothers.

372
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,287
He got lucky when his dad took him back.

373
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,705
Then take this off.

374
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,123
Why are you wearing it?

375
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,458
So he's what?

376
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,959
What do we call his kind?

377
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,879
Mom was a prostitute,
but his father is rich.

378
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,340
We need a new name
to describe someone like him.

379
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,676
Instead of half-man, half-beast…
Half-rich, half-slut?

380
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,886
Half-slut.

381
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,265
Wait. If he and Kang Ha
both went to the same school,

382
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,602
that means he must've known
everything the whole time.

383
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,395
Yeah, he sure did.

384
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,522
So you were trying to trick us all along?

385
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,400
Well…

386
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,153
-Well, the thing is--
-Jesus, he's wasting our time.

387
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,156
Stop stuttering and spit it out.
My fucking god.

388
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,492
Did you have fun trying
to make fools of us, slut? Huh?

389
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,577
Yo. I asked you a question.

390
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,162
Did you enjoy it?

391
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:47,248
-Huh? Speak up, scumbag. Was it fun?
-I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

392
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,376
Huh? Come on.

393
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,586
Why so quiet? Put that down, jeez.

394
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,422
Spit it out, douchebag. Was it fun?
Why aren't you answering?

395
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,507
Knock it off.

396
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,134
Kang Ha.

397
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,970
Hey, look who's here now.

398
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,932
It's your old middle school bro.

399
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,400
That was one hell of a plot twist, huh?

400
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,444
We were trying to find dirt on you
and dug up something else.

401
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,865
If you stay at this school,
this douchebag's done for.

402
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,493
So what'll it be? He's your friend, so…

403
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,286
Sounds like you should leave now.

404
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,622
And then we might let him stay.

405
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,672
-Who the hell are you?
-What?

406
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,465
Who are you to decide who gets to stay?

407
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,593
-Jeez, he's popping off again.
-What's he saying this time?

408
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,434
You're just a pathetic lapdog
who bullies people for Kim Ri-an.

409
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,035
Ta-da! Pass these around.

410
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,912
Oh my God! It's so pretty!

411
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,748
Invitations to Jae-i's farewell party.

412
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,584
-You're throwing a party for her?
-Of course. I'm her best friend.

413
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,628
Try to get as many people
as possible to show up.

414
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,267
What are you gonna wear
to the party?

415
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,770
-That dress from before?
-The pink one?

416
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,480
No, let's just go shopping later.

417
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,148
Hey.

418
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:38,234
-Let's just go.
-Okay. Let's do it.

419
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,601
You all right?

420
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,831
I'm sorry, Tae-ho.

421
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:39,254
I'll do whatever it takes to make sure
that Choi Yun-seok gets off your back.

422
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,380
How?

423
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,965
Are you going to kill him or something?

424
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,468
Even if you did, then what?

425
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,345
Woo-jin, Ri-an, He-ra,

426
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,264
Jae-i, Chan-min, Ba-da.

427
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,558
-Are you gonna kill them all?
-Tae-ho.

428
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,476
Killing one of them won't end this.

429
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,771
They'll just keep being
the monsters they are.

430
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,026
Let's stop.

431
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,862
We should just call it quits.

432
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,991
I need to stay at Jooshin High.
It's what my father wants.

433
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,785
I know how you feel.

434
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,290
I understand what you're going through.

435
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,457
I get it.

436
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,671
I'm just so scared, Kang Ha.

437
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,345
I can't help you anymore.

438
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,170
YEAR 2, CLASS 2

439
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,067
YOON HE-RA

440
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,779
I really said it.

441
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,540
LEE WOO-JIN

442
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,253
What's going on?
You're not answering my calls or texts.

443
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:45,964
Avoiding me, huh?

444
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:24,335
Jae-i, enjoy watching
what happens here from New York

445
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,920
once this is made public.

446
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:31,175
People like you and Ri-an are susceptible
to rumors and controversies, right?

447
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,261
Look forward to it.

448
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,405
It's someone at school,
whoever sent you those messages.

449
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,410
Sent them from Jooshin High.

450
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,721
Oh.

451
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,848
I… I'm sorry.

452
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,017
Really sorry.

453
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,723
I thought

454
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,434
you weren't coming to school anymore.

455
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,562
I'll tell you…

456
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,650
whatever you want to know…

457
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,778
about your brother.

458
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,037
We were all out partying.

459
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,917
It was Woo-jin's birthday,
and they were bullying In-han,

460
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,170
so he ran outside.

461
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,800
That's when the accident occurred.

462
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,095
He was tortured so much
he couldn't take it.

463
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,222
So much

464
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,975
he ran out into the street.

465
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,478
It was them, wasn't it?

466
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,855
Choi Yun-seok, Kim Ri-an.

467
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,189
It wasn't.

468
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,859
I know you're suspicious of Ri-an, but…

469
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,320
he wasn't behind it.

470
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,451
It was my fault.

471
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,829
If he was never friends with me,

472
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,333
then In-han wouldn't have been
bullied by everyone at school.

473
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,467
So don't blame anyone else.

474
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,847
Take it out on me.

475
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,276
Please help me.

476
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,696
I'm being blackmailed by someone here.

477
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,657
I need to find them before I leave.

478
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,410
I don't care if
they're just threatening me.

479
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,454
But Ri-an…

480
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,750
they're trying to bring him down as well.

481
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,460
If it's helping Kim Ri-an,

482
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,795
you'll need to find someone else

483
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,423
'cause I have the same goal

484
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,634
as the person threatening you.

485
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,644
You said you would help me
get through all this.

486
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,816
If Ri-an falls apart, I'll fall apart too.

487
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,446
I don't want him to get hurt.

488
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,079
And me?

489
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,291
I know it's selfish,

490
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,503
but I can't trust anyone else to help me…

491
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,340
except for you, Kang Ha.

492
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,348
I never thought…

493
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,019
you could be this cruel to me, Jae-i,

494
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,981
of all the people it could've been.

495
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,525
How could you ask that?

496
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,195
That I help Kim Ri-an.

497
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,953
He won't do it because of me.

498
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,705
-Let's go.
-Okay.

499
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,498
-Just go.
-I'm so curious.

500
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,678
Well, don't just stand there.

501
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:10,765
Waiting for me?

502
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,933
Open the door.

503
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,090
-Who is it?
-Doesn't matter.

504
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,132
Are you dating someone?

505
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,426
Don't be ridiculous.

506
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,930
I'm on edge lately.
Don't play games with me.

507
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,141
Why is that?

508
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,476
Because of Ri-an.

509
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:57,937
Or maybe it's Jae-i.

510
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,313
Or because of you.

511
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,066
What are you saying?

512
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,986
You're trying to eat the forbidden fruit,
so you brought this on yourself

513
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,280
because you're being greedy.

514
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,991
Why don't you word it differently?

515
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,786
Is it so wrong? To want more?

516
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:19,542
Whereas, on the other hand, you do nothing
to go after what you desire.

517
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,751
You never make a move.

518
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,129
We should be honest about what we want.

519
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,214
Better than lying to yourself.

520
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,884
You're extremely honest.
I respect that, He-ra.

521
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,636
But you can be too honest.

522
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,640
I'm worried about you, He-ra.

523
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:39,186
That, 'cause of your greed,
you'll lose everything.

524
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,023
Thank you for your concern,
but I don't appreciate what you just said.

525
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:46,026
I don't see anything wrong
with being ambitious with your life.

526
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,833
Thanks for the ride.

527
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,090
ON OFFICIAL DUTY

528
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,522
What's going on?

529
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,598
For my darling daughter.

530
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,850
This is for when
you want to look your best.

531
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,208
Mom.

532
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,296
What's going on?

533
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,514
I'm sorry.

534
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,808
What are we gonna do now?

535
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,019
What do we do?

536
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,401
My baby.

537
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,156
My poor baby.

538
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,617
Oh, He-ra.

539
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,887
Please help me!

540
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,431
I'm being blackmailed by someone here.

541
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:10,064
Why do you think they want us
to come to Jae-i's farewell party?

542
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,733
I know, right?
They never invite us to their parties.

543
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,109
Why do they want us there?

544
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,528
Do you think they're planning something?
Like a big prank?

545
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,864
-Well, now I'm scared to go.
-I know.

546
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:21,950
I think… we face it.

547
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,912
Are you just gonna avoid them
till graduation?

548
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,539
-We need to fight back.
-Why are you all here?

549
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:35,005
Scholarship students are not allowed
in Special Teaching Room A.

550
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,007
We were waiting
for our next class.

551
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,051
We figured the room is empty today, so…

552
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,887
Even when there aren't classes in here,
this room is still off-limits.

553
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:46,684
It's reserved exclusively for
the real Jooshin High students.

554
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:50,771
Whereas you're only here due to
the school's charitable desire to help.

555
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,109
How dare you set foot in spaces
meant for the special class students.

556
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,948
Clean everything up, then leave.

557
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,825
Come on. Clean it.

558
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,327
Right now!

559
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:24,805
Preparations are complete,
but are you sure you'll be all right?

560
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,934
If anything goes wrong,
the consequences could be disastrous.

561
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,854
-Especially if it gets back to Mrs. An.
-Make sure it doesn't.

562
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,232
And make sure… that none of it goes wrong.

563
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,362
And if it does go wrong,
and something were to happen,

564
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:41,864
then…

565
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:44,867
it'll be on me.

566
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,624
Be sure to call as soon as you get there.

567
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:53,834
I will.

568
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,586
You have nothing to worry about.

569
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,088
I'll make sure I take
good care of your daughter.

570
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,675
All right. Well, Seon-jun,
I put my trust in you.

571
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,136
-Oh, uh…
-Yes, sir?

572
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,516
Well, the exchange rate
isn't great right now…

573
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,768
Guess this is goodbye.

574
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:12,936
Safe travels, Noona.

575
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,522
Yes, sir.

576
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,651
Don't ever come back here.

577
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:23,197
Besides, you have nothing left here.

578
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:33,916
Well, dear, we don't want them to be late.
They should be going.

579
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,460
Safe travels, all right?

580
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,296
We'll let you know
when we arrive.

581
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,257
Goodbye. We'll be on our way now.

582
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,618
Later!

583
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,089
This is lit!

584
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,130
-I'm here.
-Good.

585
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,464
-Let's get a drink.
-Okay.

586
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:18,145
-Oh my God!
-Wow! It's so beautiful!

587
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,981
-Girl, let's take a quick selfie with it.
-Okay.

588
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:36,872
-Isn't that the class president?
-Guess she invited scholarship kids too.

589
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,333
That's why the venue changed
from her vacation home.

590
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,334
Really?

591
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,714
Wonder where she is?
The host is late to her own party.

592
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,301
She's allowed to show up late.
She's the guest of honor.

593
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:52,554
Girl, this is a party for Jae-i.
She's not the guest of honor.

594
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,432
My gosh, Ba-da. Are you totally oblivious?

595
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,310
-What do you mean?
-It's called a farewell party.

596
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,103
But it's more like a coronation.

597
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:04,149
"Farewell, Jung Jae-i.
The crown now belongs to Queen He-ra."

598
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:07,444
You know how it goes. Otherwise,
why wouldn't she have thrown it sooner?

599
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,156
Oh, you're right! Jae-i flies out today.

600
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:13,784
Think she left yet?

601
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,316
-Where's Ri-an?
-He's running a little late.

602
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,611
You seem kinda different.

603
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,321
Different how?

604
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:55,283
You look really, uh, normal, kinda.

605
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,911
No more flash. I want normal.

606
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,372
And I'm still pretty, even normal.

607
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,959
Mm. For sure. You're pretty.

608
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,088
By the way, I was thinking about
your advice from before.

609
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,089
What?

610
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,882
That life's too short.

611
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,469
That we have to go for…
for what we want the most.

612
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,015
I figured I should be more like you.

613
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,225
And I guess I should be a bit more honest.

614
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,771
Just do whatever you want.

615
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,734
I'm gonna make Ri-an
give me an answer tonight.

616
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,944
Because if I have him,
there won't be any issues.

617
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,321
"Issues"?

618
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,131
Hello, He-ra.

619
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,426
Thank you for the invite.

620
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,344
For inviting us all.

621
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,763
Maybe it's the outfit,

622
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,682
but you seem like
you're a different person tonight.

623
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,313
Lay low tonight.

624
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,398
We plan to have a good night.

625
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,400
Like you, Woo-jin.

626
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,372
What is it?

627
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,541
What's different?

628
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,306
WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE VIDEOS?

629
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,482
DON'T GET FLUSTERED
AND MAKE IT SO OBVIOUS

630
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,669
Didn't I tell you
you were being too obvious,

631
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,130
class president?

632
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:25,183
I found this while visiting In-han.
It's yours, isn't it?

633
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:28,353
I remember I saw it attached to your bag.

634
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,568
But I wonder.
How'd it wind up at his gravesite?

635
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,113
Why would you be visiting my brother?

636
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,449
Were you friends with In-han?

637
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,203
I was curious about that,
so I asked Tae-ho,

638
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,080
and he said something kinda weird.

639
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,916
And the new kid. Kang Ha is your friend.

640
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,378
Speaking of Kang Ha, don't you think
he looks a lot like the kid who died?

641
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,507
So I sent you that message,
just in case.

642
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,010
Your reaction was confirmation.

643
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:06,266
Jae-i said she was being blackmailed
by an anonymous account.

644
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,019
Is that you as well?

645
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,481
What do you want from me?

646
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:15,775
To know why I sent that to you?

647
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:19,154
Or to know why I was blackmailing her?

648
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:21,823
Neither.

649
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,701
I just wanna know what else you have.

650
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,289
That's all I want from you.

651
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:42,636
We're all out.

652
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,060
What?

653
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,147
Where is he?

654
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,692
Look at this. My gosh.

655
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,870
GONGSEONG CHAIRMAN'S SON
ARRESTED ON DRUG CHARGES

656
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:21,967
Let's go!
Why is a car coming in here?

657
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:57,794
Park Seon-jun?

658
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,923
You are under arrest for
violation of the Narcotics Control Act.

659
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:07,804
Let's go.

660
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,557
Don't wanna be late, do you?
It's your party.

661
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,352
What is he doing?

662
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,354
Wait, is that Jae-i?

663
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:25,905
Ri-an.

664
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,450
This was your doing.

665
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:33,163
You stopped her from flying out.

666
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:36,124
Yoon He-ra, is this
a good enough answer for you?

667
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,128
This is official.

668
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,297
Jae-i and I,

669
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,383
we're starting over.

670
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,302
We're gonna tell our parents too.

671
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,432
So from now on,

672
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:55,060
no one's gonna mess with Jae-i ever again.

673
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,355
No one.

674
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,524
Especially you.

675
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:08,573
Oh my.

676
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,492
Poor He-ra.

677
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,208
You said I could have them all?

678
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,753
I want those videos.

679
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,632
Send them over. All of it.

680
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,168
Which is cuter?

681
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:16,047
-They're both nice.
-But which is better?

682
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,590
We know you're gonna buy both.

683
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:20,426
Yeah, I know. Move.

684
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:26,766
If she was gonna buy them both all along,
why bother asking me?
