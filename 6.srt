1
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,961
HIERARCHY

2
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,812
Are you proud of yourselves?

3
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,773
I understand that my feelings
mean nothing to you,

4
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,109
but this is not how
you reject someone, Kim Ri-an.

5
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,280
Remember what I said?

6
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,533
About how if you got in my way,
I wouldn't just stand by and let you?

7
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,119
So what are you gonna do?

8
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,205
You'll just have to wait and see,
won't you?

9
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,789
Just know, whatever happens,

10
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,001
I'm not the one
who threw respect out the window.

11
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,464
Woo-jin,

12
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,966
make sure He-ra gets home safe.

13
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,219
What a bitch.

14
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,845
Yoon He-ra.

15
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,180
I should disappear.

16
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,851
It's best that I do.

17
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,116
You won't get away with this!

18
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,161
You two are done! You hear me? Get off me!

19
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,622
I won't take it anymore!

20
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,471
Let go of me!

21
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,432
What are you stopping me for?

22
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,767
Pick a side.

23
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,269
It's me or Jae-i and Ri-an!

24
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,105
Which is it? Are you on my side or not!

25
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:13,313
EPISODE 6
AN ARROW: TO THE HEART

26
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,868
What took you so long, honey?

27
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,870
I was worried
that you might've gotten lost.

28
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,084
It may not be the most comfortable,

29
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,920
but this is where we need to stay
for the time being.

30
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,088
But don't be worried.

31
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,716
I made sure that you have
a suite of your own. How's that sound?

32
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,345
I'm gonna go out and pick up some sushi.

33
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,305
Why don't you go get settled?

34
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,140
-Excuse me.
-Yes, sir.

35
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,850
-Would you show her the room?
-Sure.

36
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,645
Oh, and He-ra?

37
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,940
One more thing. I bought you a new dress

38
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,276
so that you can wear it to
your outing this weekend.

39
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,278
Try it on when you get upstairs.

40
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,956
Enjoy your stay.

41
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,654
I'll buy you
a nicer dress next time. From Dad.

42
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,963
You know,
the chef almost moved to another hotel,

43
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,506
but I convinced him to stay.

44
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,467
I know you love the food here.

45
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,931
You should say sorry to Kang Ha.

46
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,279
If I had done something
to warrant one, then I would.

47
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,364
Regardless of your intent,

48
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,618
you know that you're a big part
of how the school hierarchy works

49
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,370
and why there's so much violence.

50
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,205
Can't you see that?

51
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,207
And that's all my fault?

52
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,587
When I think about everything Kang Ha
has gone through, it makes sense.

53
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,715
Why he acts like this.

54
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,342
It's our fault he lost his brother.

55
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,014
So I'd appreciate

56
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,892
if you would give him a sincere apology.

57
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,185
Can you drop it, Jae-i?

58
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,104
We're finally having a meal together.

59
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,317
I actually feel good and normal
for the first time in a while.

60
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,318
Let's not ruin it.

61
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,862
Apologizing isn't that hard, is it?

62
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,238
I don't know how.

63
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,365
I've never had to do it before, have I?

64
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,167
Anyway…

65
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:23,836
let's stop this now.

66
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,507
We haven't been with
one another in so long.

67
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,427
So let's just enjoy it, Jae-i.

68
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,249
Judging from that expression,
you weren't exactly studying just now.

69
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:05,920
I'm sketching. Yeah.
Just sketching something.

70
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,965
I wanted to tell you,
your dad made up his mind.

71
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,716
Oh, he's gonna run?

72
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,303
And I think he'll be able to do it
with the full support of the Jaeyul Group.

73
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,348
The Jaeyul Group? Not Jooshin?

74
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,235
This hasn't gotten out.

75
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,778
What is it?

76
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,197
It's proof that
Jaeyul Group's only daughter

77
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,658
has been seeking pregnancy care abroad.

78
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,597
Kang Ha.

79
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,481
Let's go. They're all waiting.

80
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,573
You have
a dangerous taste in men.

81
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,163
What's so interesting to you
about scholarship students, I wonder?

82
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,542
I'm sure you had good intentions,
but things always seem to end so badly.

83
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,296
I heard you're not moving
to the United States anymore.

84
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,507
As your homeroom teacher,
I have to say, that makes me concerned.

85
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,427
I just don't want to see Jooshin
engulfed in yet another tragic accident.

86
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,845
You know what, Ms. Han?

87
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:42,350
Whatever my tastes are, they really aren't
that interesting compared to yours.

88
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,492
What, fight back?

89
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,453
We can't keep putting up with
this unfair treatment, can we?

90
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,664
But if you think about it,
is it that unfair?

91
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,000
We attend the most expensive school
in the country without paying a dime.

92
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,460
It's a pretty good deal.

93
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,503
Your point?

94
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,131
"Yeah, this is what we deserve."
"Thanks for walking all over us."

95
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,801
Even so, what can we do?

96
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,386
We can prove the abuse.

97
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,223
We need to teach them, once and for all,
they're not as untouchable as they think.

98
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,392
The school won't do it,
and neither will the teachers.

99
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,018
Don't expect them to.

100
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,355
Think about the influence
their parents have on Jooshin High.

101
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,232
You really think
the school will take our side?

102
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,651
Maybe you're right,
but I don't understand.

103
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,403
Why are you doing this, Kang Ha?

104
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,822
Aren't you just using us
to avenge your brother?

105
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,032
You're right.

106
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,493
That's how it started.

107
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,453
But now it's more than that.

108
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,373
If we hold back, it's never gonna stop.

109
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,792
Not after we graduate,
not for the rest of our lives.

110
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,293
Are you willing to live like that?

111
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,215
No one's ever tried to change anything.

112
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,885
Let's give it a shot.

113
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,974
Before we do this,

114
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,101
we should make sure
we have the same goals.

115
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,687
Because it won't be easy

116
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,440
taking on all the rich kids
and the school.

117
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:17,653
We can't afford to move too fast
unless you want to attack them directly.

118
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,364
"Attack directly"?

119
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,032
The school knows everything.

120
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:24,034
Every single move the students make.

121
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,578
So we need to be careful.

122
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,706
What are you talking about?

123
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,585
All that private information and videos.
Where'd you get all that?

124
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,673
JUNG JAE-I

125
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,258
COPYING 2 ITEMS TO USB

126
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,429
I can't tell you yet.

127
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,724
What matters now is that we are both
on the same page with this.

128
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,934
We attack the head first

129
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,437
by releasing the video of
Jung Jae-i and Kim Ri-an.

130
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,690
We can use the press or socials.
It'll destroy them instantly.

131
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,317
No, we can't.

132
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,402
Why the hell not?

133
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,404
Don't tell me
you actually like Jung Jae-i?

134
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,535
I need you to tell me if you and I
are in this together…

135
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,580
or not.

136
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,394
She's not answering?

137
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,022
Who'd you think I was calling?

138
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,816
He-ra.

139
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,402
She hasn't been in school
or answered my calls the past few days.

140
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,864
Her feelings must've been hurt pretty bad.

141
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,200
Ri-an seems relieved
that you guys are back together.

142
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,118
But how do you feel, Jae-i?

143
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,538
Yeah, um,

144
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,332
do I really need to answer that?

145
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,084
I just want you to make things clear.

146
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,462
We've all been struggling…
because of your decisions.

147
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,464
You all?

148
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,386
Ri-an, He-ra,

149
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,555
and me too.

150
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:17,523
If you hadn't pushed Ri-an away
and gone after that scholarship kid, then

151
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,401
He-ra wouldn't have confessed to Ri-an.

152
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,195
Then you two wouldn't have had
any issues, and then…

153
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,450
…I wouldn't be so…
fucking heartbroken now.

154
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,882
-Wow!
-Oh! Nice one!

155
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,008
-Good, right?
-Real good.

156
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,176
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Woo-jin…

157
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,764
Come on. Get over here.

158
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,683
You're not getting off easy.

159
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,851
I mean it.

160
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,520
No! Wait a second! Wait a second!
Hold on, hold on.

161
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,314
Ah!

162
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,150
-My turn.
-Oh, come on! Why does he get a turn?

163
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,277
-Those are the rules!
-Why? Ugh!

164
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,154
-Ah!
-You went easy on him!

165
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,080
So you're blaming me for everything, then?

166
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,587
I'm not blaming.

167
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,714
I'm just concerned.

168
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,010
I'm worried it'll amount to nothing.

169
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,638
All the time we spent together.

170
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,474
I'm scared it'll crumble

171
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,351
and fade away.

172
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,357
I want you to try and make sure
that doesn't happen.

173
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:42,900
Hmm?

174
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:49,281
All this time I… I never left
Ri-an's side, not even once.

175
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,745
I only made it seem that way
to make sure he was okay.

176
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,958
I thought it was
the best thing I could do,

177
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,626
and you know what?

178
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,588
I still think I was right.

179
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,384
Honestly, I don't deserve him.

180
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,436
I'll do it. I'll try my best.

181
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,564
I wanna protect us.
I want it as much as you do.

182
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,900
I'll try.

183
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,945
I'll do whatever I can.

184
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,199
And you should too.

185
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,327
You should be clear what side you're on.

186
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,247
He-ra's? Or maybe

187
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,749
the woman with the Hermès bag?

188
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,922
When your heart decides, who will it be?

189
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,111
LEE WOO-JIN

190
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,667
Wow, it feels like my birthday!

191
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,295
I must've reread your DM, like, ten times.

192
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,963
I can't believe I'm on a date with you.

193
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,840
Thanks for keeping your promise, Noona.

194
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:33,677
I don't even wanna blink! Who knows
the next time I'll get this opportunity?

195
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,221
So I'm gonna enjoy everything
while I still can.

196
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,183
You really like me that much?

197
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,145
Everyone thinks I'm a nasty snob.
They call me a bitch behind my back.

198
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,480
But that's part of your charm.

199
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,440
Hey, don't ever
let bitches become your type.

200
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,150
You're in for a life of pain.

201
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,694
Oh? Is that He-ra?

202
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,071
What brings you here?

203
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,199
I've actually
been meaning to talk to you.

204
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,325
You have?

205
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,412
As you know, my sister's
move to New York fell through.

206
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,917
So I thought that this would be
the absolute perfect moment

207
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,752
to pass a little something on to you.

208
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,170
What is it?

209
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,421
Oh, you know,

210
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,882
just my ace in the hole.

211
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,009
The ultimate card I have to play.

212
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,931
Take a look at this.

213
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:23,310
When you see it for yourself,
I think you'll agree.

214
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,188
It's all yours.

215
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:41,870
Jae-hyeok.

216
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,913
Yeah?

217
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,210
Watch it all?

218
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,003
Hmm?

219
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,464
Great, isn't it?

220
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,598
You fucking asshole.

221
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,353
I knew you sucked,
but you're an evil piece of shit, huh?

222
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,355
This really crosses the line.

223
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,024
Noona!

224
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,195
I did you a favor
since we have so much in common.

225
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,698
This is how you pay me back?
With a slap in the face?

226
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,287
Look, I admit that I am a bitch,

227
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,330
but I'm a bitch with morals,

228
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,375
and I think the comparison
to a scumbag monster like you

229
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,459
is a bit unfair.

230
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:30,961
Don't you think?

231
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,721
You crazy bitch! Seriously?

232
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,599
I mean, wow!
I can't fucking believe this shit!

233
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,394
Jung Jae-i, you idiot.

234
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,605
Is this the shit you were putting up with?

235
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,274
From that little creep?

236
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,338
Okay, ma'am. I'll leave these here.

237
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,133
You're always such a help, dear.

238
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,468
Wait right there.

239
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,679
-Ta-da!
-Oh wow!

240
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,807
You don't have to thank me.
I get paid for this, remember?

241
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,142
See ya. Have a great day.

242
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,938
My goodness.
What a sweet young man.

243
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,196
Take that! Get him, get him!

244
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,697
Hyung! Hyung!

245
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,744
-I got him, you guys!
-Hey! Gimme that that thing! Huh?

246
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,829
-I told you to be careful, didn't I?
-Hyung! Hyung!

247
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,957
You'd all be dead meat
if I didn't have an ice cream.

248
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,583
-Look at you.
-Your clothes are all wet!

249
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,336
Are you laughing at me now?
Oh, so it's a challenge, huh?

250
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,505
-Hey, hey! Hey!
-Hyung! Hyung!

251
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,006
You're dead!

252
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,509
-Hey!
-Get him! Get him! Don't stop!

253
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,803
-Hey, I surrender, I surrender! Mercy!
-You get back here!

254
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,722
-You can't get away from us!
-Hey, hey, stop, stop, stop!

255
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,599
-Look over there!
-Where are you going?

256
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,893
Hey, guys, wait for me! Wait for me!

257
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,854
Hello, Kang Ha.

258
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,034
Go on, try it. It's really good.

259
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,253
Ah! The weather's great.

260
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,172
The breeze is nice,
and the clouds are pretty too.

261
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,925
It's almost unreal.

262
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,510
Hmm?

263
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,387
How are you so happy all the time?

264
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,099
To me, the weather looks
exactly the same as it did yesterday,

265
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,267
but you think it's great.

266
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,353
You get into water gunfights

267
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,731
and have fun like a child.

268
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,030
It's like I never let myself
feel that way before.

269
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,575
I'm always on guard and anxious,

270
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,872
which is crazy because I have
so much more than you.

271
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,709
How do you find joy in such simple things?

272
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,130
Hmm.

273
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,049
On our way home from tutoring,

274
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,551
In-han and I would stop for tteokbokki.

275
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,056
An old lady ran the place.
We'd help her carry stuff.

276
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,226
And every time, the lady would
buy us both an ice cream cone.

277
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,064
It's the little stuff like that.

278
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,983
Going to the arcade and playing games.

279
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,028
Eating ice cream
out on the streets on a nice day.

280
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,823
Running to catch the bus
and snagging an empty seat.

281
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,992
I just love things like that.

282
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,204
I envy you.

283
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,123
You must have them too.

284
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,002
It might not be the breeze or the clouds,

285
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:02,714
but you have things you like,
things that bring you joy.

286
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,677
Find them

287
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,764
and protect them.

288
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,269
In my experience, if something
gets between you and those things,

289
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,356
it's better to face it head-on
than to try to run and hide.

290
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,027
Even if there's a risk of getting hurt,
try to fight back.

291
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,821
Nothing could be more worthwhile

292
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,156
than protecting the things you like.

293
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,705
I just wish you could be happy, Jae-i.

294
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,212
You never know.
You might like a water gunfight.

295
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,650
So what is it?

296
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,197
The thing you came out here to tell me.

297
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,078
I want you to tell me
what you're planning.

298
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,957
You said you'd… expose
what happened to In-han.

299
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,130
The person blackmailing you… I found them.

300
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,050
What do they want?

301
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,635
The same thing I do.

302
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,347
The chance to expose the guilty.

303
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,892
Expose everyone
behind the crimes at Jooshin

304
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,102
and to make sure they
pay the price for it.

305
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,605
I plan to join forces with them.

306
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,443
Now I have a bow ready to shoot.

307
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,822
And pretty soon, I'm going to
notch an arrow and draw it back.

308
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,617
But when I fire it,

309
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,827
I don't want that arrow hurting you.

310
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,748
I'll make sure they don't
threaten you ever again.

311
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:04,169
I can do both. I can protect you and hold
the people who killed In-han responsible.

312
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,844
I told you once before.

313
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,057
If there's anything in my life
that's worth protecting, it's Ri-an

314
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,767
and Ri-an alone.

315
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:23,855
So, if you're planning on aiming
that bow at him, look before you shoot.

316
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,191
Because that's where I'll be…

317
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,528
standing in your way.

318
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:38,662
Well, I guess that means…

319
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,207
we're enemies now.

320
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,278
I'm dating Jae-i. Of the Jaeyul Group.

321
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,863
Have been for a while now,

322
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,157
and I thought it was time
that you knew about it.

323
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,287
There isn't a privilege in the world
without responsibilities, Ri-an.

324
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,748
Considering the difficult path
ahead for you as my sole heir,

325
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,918
why preoccupy yourself
with such trivial matters?

326
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,504
I'm not interested
in living like you and Dad.

327
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,507
I have no interest in a loveless marriage,

328
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,136
exchanging empty pleasantries with
the other person once or twice a year.

329
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,805
I'm going to date someone
that I really care about.

330
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,140
I'm going to be happy.

331
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,976
"Someone you care about"?

332
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,520
I understand.

333
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,023
That seems so important
for someone your age.

334
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,359
But soon, Ri-an, you'll see that feeling
for what it really is.

335
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,946
Emotional trickery and childishness.
Nothing could be more trivial.

336
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,282
I don't really care about
what you have to say about it.

337
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,575
I can't live without her.

338
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,662
I think I've made myself clear.

339
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,832
You kept ignoring my calls.
I couldn't reach you.

340
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,501
It was frustrating.

341
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,921
I couldn't stand waiting. I had to come.

342
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,221
I went and got the car fixed. You see?

343
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,515
Like new, isn't it?

344
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,076
The car did seem fixed.

345
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,578
I couldn't find that thing.

346
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,247
I got rid of it already.

347
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,253
It could've put us in real danger.

348
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,631
That car--

349
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,925
I don't know what's gotten into me either.

350
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,554
I thought maybe you were avoiding me.

351
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,141
My feelings were all over the place.

352
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,643
I didn't know what to do.

353
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,229
I thought we agreed
that whatever was between us…

354
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,860
we would never share any emotions
that would get in the way.

355
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,046
I know this isn't love.

356
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,175
And I know that I can never have you.

357
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,968
But I'm still human, aren't I?

358
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,470
I have feelings.

359
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,430
No matter how hurt your feelings are…

360
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,059
that car isn't something
you can just take out.

361
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,896
-Remember?
-Of course.

362
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,105
How could I forget?

363
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:38,777
That car represents a secret
that neither of us want getting out.

364
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,328
It's He-ra, isn't it?

365
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,248
The woman in Lee Woo-jin's heart.

366
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,792
Let's not imagine things.

367
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,585
That gets us nowhere.

368
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,303
Leave the keys.

369
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,601
Why? Worried I might use it for blackmail?

370
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,019
It's not about that.

371
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,731
It's dangerous for you.

372
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,609
Maybe so, but it's the only thing
protecting me right now.

373
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,447
If you're worried about protection,

374
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,199
forget the car.

375
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,785
I'm your best shot at safety.

376
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,045
Maybe what we had wasn't love…

377
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,132
but at least it wasn't all a lie.

378
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,303
When I needed someone, you supported me.

379
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:52,767
But now that's over.

380
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,440
Let's end things here.

381
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,411
Very well.

382
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,580
See you at school.

383
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,318
Eyes, heart, head, neck.

384
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,821
Aim for a spot
that will kill it instantly.

385
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,576
When you see its blood spurting,
you'll know you hit true.

386
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,286
With one flick of your hand,

387
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,916
that little rabbit will be
transformed into red mist.

388
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,128
The thrill of the hunt.

389
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,924
That's how you'll grow strong.

390
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,681
What are you waiting for?
Pull the trigger.

391
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,727
Jae-i.

392
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,854
Keep your eyes open.

393
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,400
Why aren't you shooting?
End that thing's life this instant.

394
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,278
Shoot. Now!

395
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,622
Jung Jae-i.

396
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,040
I don't wanna shoot it.

397
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,459
I don't wanna murder anything.

398
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,837
I'm not coming here anymore.

399
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,089
I hate hunting,

400
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,425
your endless demands, all of it.

401
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,223
So it's rebellion, is it?

402
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,642
You're saying you intend
to disobey my commands

403
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,977
and do as you please.

404
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,311
Is that it?

405
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,981
You only see your daughter,
Jung Jae-i of Jaeyul Group.

406
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,024
But underneath, I'm just me.

407
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,567
And that gives me a right.

408
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,321
The right to be true to myself
and protect what I care about.

409
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,531
Oh, no.

410
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,242
That's not something you get to decide.

411
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,704
I gave you that name myself.

412
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,039
My blood runs through your veins.

413
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,252
What right could possibly exist

414
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,171
that allows you to give those up?

415
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,511
As long as you bear my name,

416
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,805
as long as you carry my blood,

417
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,640
you decide nothing for yourself.

418
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,103
That is your duty and your obligation.

419
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,940
The debt you owe for your life.

420
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,984
Your everything.

421
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,989
From beginning to end,
you're a part of me.

422
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,407
You're my creation.

423
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:22,852
The dynamics of East Asian
international relations were

424
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,855
underrepresented
in Eurocentric international law.

425
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,317
But the law was evolving over time.

426
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:33,362
But when you see the circumstances
of the political situation,

427
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,990
then you will understand
how we changed it.

428
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,700
So when you see this paper…

429
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:42,580
…a new branch
of international law has been…

430
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,417
Uh…

431
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,588
Find out who filmed it.

432
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,841
Whoever dared to send that to me,
I want you to find out where it came from.

433
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,302
-We'll handle it as soon as possible.
-No leaks.

434
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,387
Do whatever it takes to keep it contained.

435
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,015
This video cannot be seen by anybody.

436
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,560
No one finds out. Not the school,
and especially not my mother.

437
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:09,440
Everyone's jobs are on the line,
so keep it from getting out, understand?

438
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,495
TRADING FIRM INTERNATIONAL YOON
FACING BANKRUPTCY

439
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,626
Did you see this?
Is this for real?

440
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,754
It says He-ra's family is bankrupt,
and they're going under.

441
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,132
-Damn.
-What's gonna happen to her now?

442
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,342
Rejected by Ri-an. Enemies with Jae-i.

443
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:39,011
If her family is broke,
our Queen He-ra is done for.

444
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,013
What? Queen He-ra, my ass!

445
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,141
After all the shit she's pulled
at this school?

446
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,601
You bet your ass she's finished!

447
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:56,529
I'm taking attendance now.
Sit down, everyone.

448
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:03,995
Come with me.

449
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,337
There's something I need to tell you.

450
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,797
What is it?

451
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,175
Last year at the villa,

452
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,886
someone filmed us there.

453
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,307
But don't worry about it.

454
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,517
I'm gonna deal with everything. I promise.

455
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,394
Who sent you the video?

456
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:29,604
I'm finding out.

457
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,772
Just stay by my side, Jae-i.

458
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,065
We'll get through this.

459
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,442
Don't run away again.

460
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,985
Let me protect you.

461
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,371
I'm willing
to give you one last chance.

462
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:51,042
You know better than anyone
what's been going on here at Jooshin High.

463
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:55,254
Follow your own regulations…
and punish the students responsible.

464
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,674
I am giving you one final opportunity

465
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,927
to bring this school
back to its original mission.

466
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,555
And where do you get this confidence?

467
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,391
Simple.

468
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,562
You see, I have a secret weapon
that could blow Jooshin away.

469
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,441
What's that?

470
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,693
If you continue to enable abuse,

471
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,154
you'll leave us no choice.

472
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,615
We'll blow it all up in your face.

473
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,336
Are you crazy? Why the fuck
did you meet with the principal

474
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,712
without telling me about it?

475
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,089
I'm going to do this right.

476
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,801
If you wanna do this right,
we should hit Kim Ri-an, like I said.

477
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,552
You said start at the top.

478
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,513
All the adults who let this happen,

479
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,765
they're at the top.

480
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,558
Is this why you wanted to team up?

481
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,019
What are you actually
trying to get from me?

482
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,440
Don't tell me.

483
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,610
You're doing this to protect Jung Jae-i?

484
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,280
Nam Ju-won, what are you talking about?

485
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,699
Uh-huh, I'm right, aren't I?
It is for her!

486
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,701
Do you know
what kind of secrets she's hiding?

487
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,911
You haven't seen everything yet.
If you only knew what--

488
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,037
It was you.

489
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,297
The blackmailer.

490
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,688
So that's it.
You've drawn your bow, haven't you?

491
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,525
I told you I'd make them
suffer the consequences.

492
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,737
I'm gonna tell my father,
and I'll tell the school.

493
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,531
I'll tell them a video like that exists,

494
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:48,075
and there are people
threatening to release it to the world.

495
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,245
If I tell them myself,
I can still get ahead of it.

496
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,664
No. Why would you?
If you do that, you'll--

497
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,458
My dad would kill me, for a start.

498
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,627
He'd drag me away and hide me in New York.

499
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,254
But even so,

500
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,715
at least they'll be able to stop it.

501
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,759
My dad and the school,

502
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,346
they'll do whatever it takes
to make sure that video never gets out.

503
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,222
It's what they do.

504
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,809
Then what? Suffer the consequences alone?
Take it all on yourself?

505
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,728
What happens to me doesn't matter.

506
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,814
As long as I can protect Ri-an.

507
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:23,736
Why?

508
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,239
He's everything.

509
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,616
Exactly! Why?

510
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,701
Why is your everything…

511
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,705
…somebody like him?

512
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,836
Because no matter what,

513
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,547
he feels the same way.

514
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,008
That's how we grew up.

515
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,511
Relying on each other to survive.

516
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,140
If Ri-an falls apart, then so will I.

517
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,475
Well, go ahead, then.

518
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,853
But I won't give up.

519
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,733
Whether or not you protect Kim Ri-an,
whether or not we all die…

520
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,195
I'm going to see this through.

521
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,329
I was pregnant.

522
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,503
Don't turn around.

523
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,713
Just stand and listen.

524
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,635
I was scared.

525
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,807
I was scared of my father,
that he'd cast me out like my mom.

526
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,103
Afraid that I'd lose
everything I had overnight

527
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,688
and be kicked out of my home.

528
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,608
So I went to the United States
to take care of it.

529
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:50,990
But I couldn't do it.

530
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,703
I turned back from the hospital twice.

531
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,164
I couldn't figure out what to do.

532
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,583
But then, one day…

533
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,336
I was in so much pain.

534
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,884
I guess it must have known
what I was trying to do.

535
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,471
And so, as fast as it came,

536
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,557
it was suddenly gone.

537
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,652
And Kim Ri-an?

538
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,323
Does he…

539
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,079
He doesn't.

540
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:42,291
So I…

541
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,045
did my best to avoid him.

542
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,925
I couldn't bear to look at Ri-an
and pretend like nothing happened.

543
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,513
I told myself, "It's better this way.
Now, things can go back to normal."

544
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,432
That's why I went to the States
in the first place.

545
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,770
I really believed
if I just broke up with Ri-an,

546
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,314
then I could be free of it all.

547
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,860
And maybe I could've.

548
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,660
Then you showed up and ruined it all.

549
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,496
Yes, you, Kang Ha.

550
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,457
You told me to face my fears
instead of running away.

551
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,085
You dug up memories I thought I'd buried.

552
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,131
Awoke a feeling I didn't know I had.

553
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:33,968
It was you.

554
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,738
In fact, from now on…

555
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,826
I'll do exactly what you told me to.

556
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,289
You're gonna fight back?

557
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,708
I'm going to protect the things I like.

558
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,253
So, if you need to draw your bow,
go ahead and shoot.

559
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,383
And when you do,
I'll happily stand in your way.

560
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,523
There you are.

561
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,029
How long have you been staying here?

562
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,114
You should've told us
things were this bad.

563
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,617
Sorry, "us?" Who does that mean?

564
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,118
Kim Ri-an and Jung Jae-i?

565
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,079
Or people like Woo-jin
who refuse to take a side?

566
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,456
Who is this "us" you're referring to?

567
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,919
We should at least get you out of here.
I'll find a solution.

568
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,588
You can come with me to my studio for now.

569
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,840
What are you? My knight in shining armor?

570
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,385
You're making things worse.
I already feel like trash as it is.

571
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,595
-He-ra.
-I'm gonna drop out.

572
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,181
I don't have a place here anymore.

573
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,308
Let's just say goodbye
and be done with it.

574
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,644
There's no reason for us to stay friends.

575
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,229
Hey, what are you talking about?

576
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,730
I'm so sick of all of you.

577
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,941
Especially Jae-i, for letting herself be--

578
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,280
There's no point explaining it to you.

579
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,159
So it's because of us?
We're the reason you're leaving school?

580
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,578
I just don't wanna see you guys anymore.

581
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,163
Then you're still upset.

582
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,249
Well, yeah! How do you think I feel, then?

583
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,876
After all the things that Jung Jae-i did.

584
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,131
That stupid bitch.

585
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,676
How could my supposed "best friend"
tell me nothing?

586
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,977
You said to pick a side?

587
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,773
I choose yours, Yoon He-ra.

588
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:38,861
So what?

589
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,447
You've chosen,
so then what's in it for me?

590
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,157
Vengeance.

591
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,326
Don't drop out.

592
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,287
I'll take care of it.

593
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,169
APPLICATION TO WITHDRAW ENROLLMENT

594
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,546
NAME: YOON HE-RA

595
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,507
REASON FOR WITHDRAWAL

596
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,347
So that's it? You're running away?

597
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,350
You always make things so extreme.

598
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,061
What exactly are you planning to do
after dropping out?

599
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,021
God, you guys are so annoying.

600
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,983
Is it your turn to bother me now, Jae-i?

601
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,527
Take care of yourself first!

602
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,073
Jung Jae-i, do you know
what kind of place Jooshin is?

603
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,242
What do you mean?

604
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,035
It's a jungle.

605
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:13,664
The kind of place where if you let your
guard down for a second, you get eaten.

606
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,668
But there's still one thing
everyone here can agree on.

607
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:21,129
That this school should be a living hell
for anyone too poor or underprivileged.

608
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,924
Isn't that why we look down
on the scholarship students

609
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,634
and treat them like they're invisible?

610
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,678
Am I wrong?

611
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,889
Do you really expect me
to end up like them?

612
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,058
That's not what I said.

613
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,894
Well, whatever you meant, forget me.
Worry about yourself.

614
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,479
Don't you have bigger fish to fry?

615
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,815
What are you trying to say?

616
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,362
You've never told me anything
about your own life either!

617
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,614
So what gives you
the right to dictate mine?

618
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:53,537
Jung Jae-i, did you ever even
once consider me as your friend?

619
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,807
Hey, it's Yoon He-ra.

620
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,269
-Look.
-Didn't her family go bankrupt?

621
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,566
You idiot.

622
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,319
"Idiot"?

623
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,696
That's a bit aggressive
for "good morning," don't you think?

624
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,239
Well, it's an insult.

625
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:32,367
What kind of idiot
can't even protect his own girlfriend?

626
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,202
I'm sorry?

627
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,499
The recording? The vacation house?

628
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,253
Gee, I wonder who had the chance
to film you guys there.

629
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,841
What did you say? Who told you that?

630
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,593
It's Jae-i's vacation house.

631
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:53,138
Who's the one other person
who would've been there besides you guys?

632
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,349
I hate that class so much, dude.

633
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,434
-Get out of the way.
-Beat it, kids.

634
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,618
Hey! Everyone except Jae-hyeok, out!

635
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:15,577
Hey, get out!

636
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,871
-Get lost!
-Let's go! Move it, move it!

637
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,623
Hey, you heard him. Get out!

638
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:35,931
You little piece of shit.

639
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:37,516
What the hell were you filming us for?

640
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,768
What the fuck were you planning, huh?

641
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,604
Oh shit! Yoon He-ra, you bitch.

642
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,149
Oh, Ri-an, you got it all wrong.

643
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,823
They're just having a conversation.

644
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,784
-Get lost, you little pricks!
-What the hell is going on?

645
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,703
Wow, this is crazy.

646
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:58,954
Just be quiet.

647
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,104
You piece of shit!

648
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,691
Do you have any idea
what the hell you've done?

649
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,027
Shit.

650
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,114
You fucking…

651
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,620
Ri-an! Are you crazy?

652
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,206
-Hey! You get back here!
-Cut it out, man!

653
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,292
Goddammit! Get your filthy hands off me!

654
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,502
You fucking scholarship trash.

655
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,757
-Move.
-Stop it.

656
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,259
-Move!
-I said, stop!

657
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,510
Damn it!

658
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,933
Get outta here
before I kill you too, okay?

659
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,269
-Just cut it out.
-Son of a bitch!

660
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,896
Think before you act!

661
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:09,149
How do you think Jae-i would feel
if she found out you were beating people?

662
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,780
How dare you.

663
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,283
How dare you speak her name.

664
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,285
You're so pathetic.

665
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,370
What?

666
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:25,499
You have no idea
what Jae-i is going through, do you?

667
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,833
All because of you!

668
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:32,047
What she's going through,
or what she's prepared to suffer.

669
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,342
What are you trying to say, huh?

670
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,760
And worst of all,

671
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,638
she's dealing with it all alone.

672
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,181
Tell me now!

673
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,600
Tell me!

674
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,937
I'm asking you to tell me
what you're talking about.

675
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:48,730
Hey.

676
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,732
Answer me.

677
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:53,026
What the fuck don't I know about?

678
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,779
You protect her from now on.

679
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,407
Make sure she doesn't go through it alone.

680
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,167
-Hey, give me the ball.
-Pass, pass.

681
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,127
Come on, pass.

682
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,004
Come on, tell me.

683
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,804
You can't get this.
Just try. Try to get it.

684
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,139
Hey, the bus is here.

685
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,224
Hey, hey, let's go, let's go, let's go.

686
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,936
-Hey!
-Hey, you get on first.

687
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,464
This is a nice dress.

688
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,136
What is this? A victory lap?

689
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:04,014
Are you here to congratulate yourself
on how low I've sunk?

690
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,851
I'm not here for any of that.

691
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,938
I just wanted to set the record straight.

692
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:18,987
Never… have I thought of you
as anything but a friend.

693
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,950
You've always been my best friend

694
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,744
from the first time we hung out

695
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,246
until right now.

696
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:40,842
What's this, all of a sudden?

697
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,391
-Hey, Dad.
-He-ra!

698
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,228
It's over.
Everything's going to be all right.

699
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,063
The company! We can keep it afloat!

700
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:57,025
-Is this for real?
-Of course. As real as anything!

701
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,486
The Jaeyul Group
came through for us after all.

702
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,321
There's nothing to worry about.

703
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,907
See you soon, darling. I love you.

704
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:10,997
Did you do this?

705
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:13,875
Like I said,

706
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,754
I've never thought of you as anything
but my best friend.

707
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,343
Jung Jae-i.

708
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:27,931
Pregnant?

709
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,395
You…

710
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:38,066
You must be trying your hardest
to drive me completely insane!

711
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:41,820
How is it possible the daughter I raised
bears such a chilling resemblance

712
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,071
to her mother?

713
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:48,451
I'm not waiting for the rumors to start.
You're leaving for New York immediately.

714
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:55,417
Answer.

715
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,294
I'll go.

716
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,254
On one condition.

717
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,007
He-ra's father's company,
International Yoon,

718
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,508
I want you to help them.

719
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,428
He-ra's my best friend in the world.

720
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:09,014
I don't think you're in any position
to make demands.

721
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:13,435
Furthermore, give me one good reason
why I should do what you're asking.

722
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:17,230
I'll do what you want.
I'll go to New York without complaining.

723
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:21,192
After all, I'm the link between
Jaeyul and the Gongseong Group.

724
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,069
I'll play along.

725
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,535
I'm going to New York.

726
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:33,830
Come visit. I'll take you out to eat.

727
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,911
Can we stop for a second?

728
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,477
How could you keep that from me?

729
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,354
How could you?

730
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,651
How could you bear it all alone?

731
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:48,947
So you…

732
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,617
you found out.

733
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,829
How do you expect me to live
with the guilt of leaving you alone?

734
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,164
The guilt of not being there by your side!

735
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,293
How?

736
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,299
How, Jae-i? How can I forgive myself?

737
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,350
No matter how I try to run away,

738
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,478
it feels like I can't.

739
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,106
Why, Jae-i? Why are you running away?

740
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:29,195
I'm here.
I'm right by your side, aren't I?

741
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:39,080
I never wanted you to get hurt, so…

742
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,002
I did my best to shield you from it.

743
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,716
I just get so sad
when I look at you that I…

744
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,012
I couldn't bear it
if you looked that way at me.

745
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,725
I thought if I ran away,
I could escape it.

746
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,480
But of course…

747
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:06,941
here we are now.

748
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,203
You must have been so afraid.

749
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,080
How could you go through that all alone?

750
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,001
I'm sorry.

751
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,296
I'm just so sorry for everything, Jae-i.

752
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:36,930
Can you ever forgive me?

753
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:41,809
I swear, I won't let you go through
anything like that alone ever again.

754
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,228
Never again.

755
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,564
I won't let you go ever again.

756
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,771

SHARE

760
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,664
If I knew you'd
weaponize something like this,

761
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:46,666
I never would've joined you.

762
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,626
You have countless videos

763
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:51,796
of Kim Ri-an and Choi Yun-seok
attacking so many people with their gang.

764
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,009
Shouldn't those videos
be more than enough?

765
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,053
Roughhousing?

766
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,139
That's not a scandal.

767
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,475
If it's not a scandal,
it doesn't do any damage.

768
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,019
Give me my phone back.

769
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,062
I can't.

770
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,317
Jung Jae-i knows who I am already.

771
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,778
Do you wanna play fair?
We can't win against them by playing fair.

772
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,114
We need to destroy them.

773
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,657
Kim Ri-an, Jung Jae-i.

774
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,744
Before they destroy me for this.

775
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,706
Give it back. Give it back!

776
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,833
This isn't how we win, Nam Ju-won!

777
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:33,171
We're trying to get justice for everyone,
not destroy somebody's life!

778
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:34,797
You bastard!

779
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,966
You're still protecting Jung Jae-i?

780
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,719
Yeah? Snap out of it!

781
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,805
Have you forgotten why you're here?
Your brother, Kang In-han!

782
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,437
Have you forgotten
what they did to your brother?

783
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:18,299
Ri-an?

784
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,096
These tears,

785
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,599
they won't stop, Woo-jin.

786
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,354
I really just wish I could stop crying.

787
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,152
And I can't.

788
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,994
So, Mr. Woo-jin…

789
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:54,877
…what is it that you want from me
in exchange for this?

790
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,218
Jae-i.

791
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,887
Send her to New York.

792
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,352
Just make her leave.

793
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:13,104
Make sure…

794
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,858
that she never comes back.

795
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:23,865
I hope you'll do this for me.

796
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:25,950
Because if you don't,

797
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:29,620
