1
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,961
HIERARCHY

2
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,156
Woo-jin.

3
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,409
You didn't have to come.

4
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,537
It's your first birthday
since we've been together.

5
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,706
I wanted a proper celebration so…

6
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,916
How so?

7
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,714
Your present.

8
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,674
I'll need more than that.

9
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,056
Here's your second present.

10
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,602
Don't be late.

11
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,920
M… Ms. Han?

12
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,797
In-han?

13
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,550
What are you--

14
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,344
In-han. It's not like that.

15
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,888
Just leave him.
I'll have the guys handle it.

16
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,723
Don't do that. No one can know about this.

17
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,642
In-han!

18
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,852
In-han!

19
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,022
No.

20
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,784
Woo-jin, hey.
You seen that scholarship kid?

21
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,786
He ran off
right when things were getting fun.

22
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,538
-Where'd he go?
-Hey!

23
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,206
Let's take it easy.

24
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,542
It's fun and games till someone gets hurt.

25
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,878
Well? Go back in.

26
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,005
Let's go back.

27
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,798
-Why you so mad, bro?
-The roof.

28
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,758
Or the back.
Let's check out the back.

29
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,220
Just leave him.

30
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,683
He's a scholarship kid.
Why are you chasing that guy?

31
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,935
He's my friend.

32
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:06,936
Were you crying?

33
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,189
Why do you look like that?

34
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,774
It's nothing. I'm… I'm good.

35
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,652
No, it's obviously not nothing.
What's going on?

36
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,363
You don't know
what my dad is like.

37
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,115
-We'll figure something out.
-Wait.

38
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,955
I'll talk to the guys
and tell them to get off his back.

39
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,458
Why don't we just go inside?

40
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,507
In-han!

41
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,094
In-han!

42
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,353
Kang. Kang Ha. Kang Ha.

43
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,023
LITTLE BROTHER

44
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,542
In-han, listen to me! Huh? In-han!

45
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,588
In-han!

46
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,608
MS. HAN JI-SU

47
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,902
In-han, let's just talk about it.

48
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,153
-You're crazy.
-Where are you?

49
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,281
-You're all crazy!
-Let's talk face-to-face.

50
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,242
…students, the entire school
are all completely deranged.

51
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,536
In-han, hear me out.
Let's talk about this.

52
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,746
-Stop it! Leave me alone.
-Just tell me where you are.

53
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,624
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Let's talk face-to-face.

54
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,251
In-han, please listen to me!

55
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,836
I don't care!

56
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,587
Come on, In-han!

57
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,841
-I'll expose everything that's going on!
-Let's talk. I'm your teacher.

58
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,482
Hello? Wait. What… what was that?

59
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,360
-What happened, what happened?
-Kang…

60
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,903
-Answer me.
-Kang Ha.

61
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,155
-In-han!
-Kang Ha.

62
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,991
Answer me! Where are you right now? Shit.

63
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,994
Okay. Hold on, hold on. Okay?
Hold on. I'll call you right back, okay?

64
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,996
I'll call you right back!

65
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,564
In-han…

66
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,368
In-han?

67
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,371
In-han?

68
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,995
EPISODE 7. SPRING TIME:
OUR SHORT, VULNERABLE YET PRECIOUS CHAPTER

69
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,625
SEOUL YONGHO POLICE STATION

70
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,680
Bullying?

71
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,057
My friends and I are at the level

72
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,769
where we wouldn't put ourselves
in that situation.

73
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,355
We don't have a need to bully anyone.

74
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,441
I actually find all of this rather rude.

75
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,652
What evidence says
I did anything wrong in this school?

76
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,449
Attorney Kim, don't we, you know,
have the right not to answer?

77
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,784
Those drugs were prescribed
by a medical professional.

78
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,912
He suffers from anxiety.

79
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,955
If you don't believe me,
test my hair.

80
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,166
Look, I just said I didn't do it, bro!

81
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,459
I'm not a bully!

82
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,920
I never
laid a finger on that kid.

83
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,297
I was just showing off magic tricks.
That's all, you know?

84
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,715
I was just…

85
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:31,052
I was just trying to be
the best upperclassman that I could

86
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,179
and help him survive through school.

87
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,932
No one ever put me up to anything.

88
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,059
I don't know.

89
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,436
We'd just attend some parties

90
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,856
but never bullied or done drugs.

91
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,024
No drugs either.

92
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,359
We're good students.

93
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,986
We weren't involved in any of that.

94
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,321
We were involved.

95
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,201
And I take responsibility
for my part in all of it.

96
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,253
You have some nerve.

97
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,800
In all my years, I've never
seen a scholarship student like you.

98
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:15,179
I had no idea
that you would wreak all this havoc

99
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,223
on everyone at Jooshin.

100
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,351
That's what I came here to do.

101
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,899
To do everything to make things right
no matter what.

102
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,402
And catch who killed my brother.

103
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,621
I'll never be able to go back
and prevent what they did on that day.

104
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,875
But I can absolutely get revenge
on every one of those bullies.

105
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,877
I'll get justice
by bringing them all down.

106
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,471
Please don't tell me
that you're one of those people.

107
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,599
Are you?

108
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,366
Hey!

109
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,329
You called the cops on me?
Really?

110
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,498
For drugs and bullying?
Got fuckin' evidence?

111
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,586
Seriously. You barely even know me.
What gives you the right?

112
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,004
I've done nothing to you!

113
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,923
What'd you hand over to the police?
What was it?

114
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,469
I wanna see your little videos.
Come on. Show me.

115
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,637
Actually…

116
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,265
Just leave, and don't think about
coming back here.

117
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,850
I thought I told you before.

118
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,313
I'm the one who decides
whether I stay or not.

119
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,775
You don't have the right to force me,
Choi Yun-Seok.

120
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,360
Why wouldn't he be able to?

121
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,612
You kids don't pay a dime to come here.

122
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,448
We have to pay tuition
and your development fund.

123
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:00,868
Have you ever thought about that?
Who's footing the bill for your benefits?

124
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,745
Seems selfish to me.

125
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,914
Right, He-ra?

126
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,713
That's right.

127
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,593
Scholarships are given out
'cause "noblesse oblige" and all that.

128
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,889
But that's all it is,
so don't go getting it backwards.

129
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,141
You've never heard of
"don't bite the hand that feeds?"

130
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,561
That's a really crappy reason.

131
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,647
-What is his deal?
-What the hell?

132
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,566
So it's okay to treat them badly
'cause they don't pay to go to school?

133
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,567
What is this shit?

134
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,819
He's right about that!

135
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,029
We shouldn't have to be
marginalized and bullied

136
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,823
just because we're not rich kids.

137
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,951
Have you lost your damn minds?

138
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,329
If you don't wanna be reported,
you shouldn't've done anything wrong.

139
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,000
-You don't know when to stop.
-Let go, Choi Yun-seok.

140
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,881
Jae-i.

141
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,009
Please tell me you're not taking his side.

142
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,011
Kang Ha isn't the one who's wrong.

143
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,054
We're in the wrong.

144
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,185
The rest of you shouldn't be afraid
to cooperate with the police.

145
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,646
The mistreatment you faced at school…

146
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,939
Go and tell them.

147
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,899
About everything.

148
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,446
Make us face what we've done.

149
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:19,905
That way…

150
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,659
no one goes through it again.

151
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,254
Oh my God.

152
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,615
Why don't you get
what I'm saying?

153
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,825
The police came here to the school!

154
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,078
But, Mom, I didn't hit anyone.

155
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,248
Well, I did hit some people,
but it's not like that.

156
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,501
And I told you, I didn't do it
'cause I wanted to.

157
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,877
Never mind. We'll talk later.

158
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,012
Oh goddammit.

159
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,727
You think he's being ridiculous?

160
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,107
I mean, you know Chan-min's right.

161
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,819
He never wanted to bully anyone.

162
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,571
He did it 'cause you all said to.

163
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,782
So he could fit in with you.

164
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,747
What about it?

165
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,749
Anything else?

166
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,336
I mean, you said you were here
to right some wrongs.

167
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,632
So what now?

168
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,300
It was on your birthday.

169
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,220
Right?

170
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,099
But you dodged a bullet somehow.

171
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,643
You weren't in any of the videos. Lucky.

172
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,479
So what now?

173
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,566
I'm just getting started.

174
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,652
Everyone responsible should be punished.

175
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,407
And I'll make sure
they get what they deserve.

176
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,097
Do you really have to go to New York?

177
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,017
It's already been decided.

178
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,147
I don't ever
wanna leave you alone again.

179
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,191
To think of how hard it all must've been…

180
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,528
I can't tell you how sorry I--

181
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,822
You don't have to
keep saying sorry, Ri-an.

182
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,200
I know exactly how you feel.

183
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,636
Ri-an, give me a minute.

184
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,637
Mm.

185
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,647
WE FOUND OUT WHO SENT THE VIDEO
IT WAS PRINCIPAL PARK HUI-SEON

186
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,527
Nam Ju-won!

187
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,031
-I wanna talk to you.
-Let go.

188
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,116
The video that you sent me.

189
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,827
I could report it to the police.

190
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,126
Nam Ju-won.

191
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,380
I didn't know anything about you
before you blackmailed me.

192
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,007
But even now,
I have trouble understanding.

193
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,135
Why would you do that?

194
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,973
Just think about all you've done.

195
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,476
You had the students
in the palm of your hand.

196
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,144
You even had control of the teachers.

197
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,980
You ruled Jooshin, and I…

198
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,108
despised you.

199
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,198
Out of all the videos he gave the cops,

200
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,493
you didn't include the videos
that you were blackmailing me with.

201
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,912
Yeah, he didn't use
the most important videos.

202
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,082
I didn't share those.

203
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,960
Does that mean

204
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,254
you're holding on to that threat?

205
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,466
Thinking about it.

206
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,385
You know what
I think that sounds like?

207
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,095
You won't actually do it,

208
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,513
and I bet you never will.

209
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,142
Probably because
you're protecting something.

210
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,143
Like I am.

211
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,313
'Cause you know very well
that by making it public, then

212
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,399
your mother will get hurt.

213
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,904
And the reason
I was the one you went after

214
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,866
was because you were afraid of Ri-an.

215
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,625
Jae-i seems so different.

216
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,170
Different? How?

217
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,173
Well, for example, when did she start
speaking up for others?

218
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,883
She's definitely changed.

219
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,929
When do you think she'll come back to us?
Honestly, I kinda miss her already.

220
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,432
The cold Jung Jae-i
I've always known, you know?

221
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,809
Don't know.

222
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,978
But why do you even care?

223
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,438
She's leaving soon.

224
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,065
I should stop caring because she's gone?

225
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,566
But you hated Jae-i.

226
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,777
You wanted her
to leave Jooshin more than anyone.

227
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,279
Yeah. Well, that was just--

228
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,406
That was when
I was extremely pissed at her!

229
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,785
These kinda things happen
between friends, you know?

230
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,828
You said you weren't friends anymore.

231
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,081
And that you'd get your revenge on her.

232
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,085
In the end, it was Jae-i
who saved me from hell.

233
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,587
I guess she's always been that way.

234
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,382
Ever since we were little,
she always accepted how bitchy I was.

235
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,552
After that, I wanted to start acting
like a real friend from now on.

236
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,430
But now she's leaving us.

237
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,108
That video.

238
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,777
Did you send it, Principal Park?

239
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,488
"Video?" What do you mean by that?

240
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,365
Where and how did you get it?

241
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,202
What the hell are you trying to pull?
Do you have any idea what you've done?

242
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,662
Slow down.

243
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,288
Don't ignore what I asked you.

244
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,998
Now give me an answer.

245
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,672
This is

246
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,342
a private institution
affiliated with the Jooshin Group,

247
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,426
and you're its heir.

248
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,594
So what?

249
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,848
I'm telling you that when it comes to you,

250
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,476
I don't have any power
to make decisions independently.

251
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,272
My mother?

252
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,822
Were you spying on me?

253
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,949
Seriously, what's the matter with you?

254
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,870
Fine, let's put aside
the fact that you spied on me,

255
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,080
even though
you completely crossed the line.

256
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,999
But why would you send me that video?

257
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,128
Because I was concerned.

258
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,591
If you were to keep seeing each other,
and she wound up pregnant,

259
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,717
it'd be a headache.

260
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,969
It was a reality check.

261
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,098
-What the hell?
-How dare you raise your voice at me!

262
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,476
You're my only son
and the heir of Jooshin!

263
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,354
But before being all those things,
I'm also a person.

264
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,940
I'm not your pet dog on a chain!

265
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,985
I can't stay. You're suffocating me here.

266
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,820
It's miserable.

267
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,365
You know, I almost wish you decided
to throw me away like my father.

268
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,586
All right, I'm done.

269
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,591
I can't quit being your son,
but I… I can quit being your heir.

270
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,010
Ri-an!

271
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,351
How could you say something like that?

272
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,145
You are my son.

273
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,484
My only son, the owner of Jooshin,
and the center of my entire world.

274
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,861
Those things…

275
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,613
I want you to remain all three.

276
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,325
You are my one and only hope, Ri-an.

277
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,765
-Good afternoon! How are you?
-Oh, hello.

278
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,586
I didn't think
you would actually go to the police.

279
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,339
A school should protect its students.

280
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,925
And they didn't do their duty.

281
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,679
Well, you certainly
found justice for them.

282
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,975
You got revenge for your brother.

283
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,644
You righted all those wrongs.

284
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,146
He would've done the same.

285
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,400
He never would've tolerated
what they were doing.

286
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,484
He wouldn't.

287
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,571
I knew In-han.

288
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,865
That's exactly who he was.

289
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,244
I don't really think of it as revenge.

290
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,663
I think it's just…

291
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,001
us paying for all the things
that we did to him.

292
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,546
So I'm willing to take
whatever it is on the chin.

293
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,467
There's a lot of things
that I was never taught.

294
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,387
Things I never quite understood
were wrong.

295
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,807
Things that I enabled and let slide.

296
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,232
It would've been nice
if we had learned it sooner.

297
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,196
Before we lost In-han.

298
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,542
I apologize…

299
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,213
for not realizing it sooner.

300
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,676
And also for

301
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,555
having been selfish
and only trying to protect Ri-an.

302
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,308
I'm sorry too…

303
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,021
for making it hard.

304
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,951
Soon, I'm leaving for New York.

305
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,455
To New York?

306
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,290
What'll happen to you then?

307
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,667
Oh, nothing.

308
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,380
I'll go on as Jung Jae-i of
the Jaeyul Group. That's it.

309
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,757
So, Kang Ha,

310
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,718
take care.

311
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,222
Become top student.

312
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,480
Jae-i.

313
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,485
Did you…

314
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,239
ever have feelings for me at any point?

315
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,374
Honestly, no.

316
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,667
Not even a little.

317
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,717
Stop lying.

318
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,283
I'm sorry.

319
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,246
This is all my fault.

320
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,121
Kang In-han.

321
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,164
How are you?

322
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,462
Say hi.

323
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,678
I invited Ri-an because I thought
he might have something to say to you.

324
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:45,348
KANG IN-HAN
APR 13, 2007 - OCT 27, 2023

325
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,611
I think we should
take a step back and slow down,

326
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,156
try to make things right, one at a time.

327
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,033
I'll do everything I can

328
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,370
right up until I leave for New York.

329
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,665
Jae-i.

330
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,506
Is this really the end for us?

331
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,845
It's not the end.

332
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,724
The two of us are only 18, Ri-an.

333
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,063
It's just… a little pause.

334
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,400
We'll still be thinking about each other.

335
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,576
I don't think I can go on without you.

336
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,703
And you?

337
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,121
Without me, could…

338
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,957
could you go on?

339
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,550
Will Kang Ha get an apology?

340
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,635
He will.

341
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,012
I'm begging you, please don't go.

342
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,226
Ri-an,

343
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,270
to me, it feels like

344
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,523
this is our punishment.

345
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,193
This is how we're paying
for what we've done.

346
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,738
Or at least, that's how I think of it.

347
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,867
We left people with scars
that will never heal.

348
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,119
We both did.

349
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,378
So we should also

350
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,005
take accountability for it.

351
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,384
Embrace it.

352
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,279
One moment.

353
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,757
How did you get that?

354
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,760
Ms. Han Ji-su. This is Jooshin.

355
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,555
A relationship with a student…

356
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,392
How could you abuse
your position like that?

357
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:38,396
I'm sure you're well aware of
the position this will put us in.

358
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,149
All that's been going on
has been a blight on this school.

359
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,483
And if this gets out…

360
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,278
I think you can imagine how that'd go.

361
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,575
Mr. Woo-jin's parents
would like to keep this matter quiet,

362
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,410
so I'll be clear about this.

363
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,498
As soon as you leave here today,
you will submit your resignation

364
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,833
and leave the school.

365
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,045
E-TICKET CONFIRMATION

366
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,880
Principal Park, I'm--

367
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,090
You really should be thankful
that his parents are being

368
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,218
as generous and considerate
as they are right now.

369
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:13,598
Remember that generosity
often masks something else, as you know.

370
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,937
Was it Woo-jin…

371
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,148
who revealed it?

372
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:26,194
Ms. Han, if it wasn't
for Mr. Woo-jin's intervention,

373
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,278
odds are good

374
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,782
that you'd be in prison
for that hit-and-run.

375
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,535
In return, we expect your silence

376
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,497
on your inappropriate relationship
and all other matters.

377
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,971
Should we all go on a trip together
before she leaves?

378
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,182
We could go somewhere close by.

379
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,350
No, thanks.

380
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,143
I'm good.

381
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,812
Let's not make a fuss.

382
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:04,190
It's not like I'll be
on a different planet or something.

383
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,652
-Hey, Woo-jin?
-Yeah?

384
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,903
Are you all right?

385
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,279
Yeah.

386
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,535
Can you come back here during breaks?

387
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,079
I wouldn't count on it.
I've been told not to return.

388
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,789
Man, he really got his vengeance.

389
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,126
What do you mean?

390
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:26,212
That idiot went and exposed everyone here.
Now you have to go to New York.

391
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,673
And you're being torn away
from the three of us.

392
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,008
That's so revenge.

393
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,720
After everything that he's been through,
I don't think it's enough.

394
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,527
Vengeance.

395
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,036
What did you do?

396
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,497
What the hell did you do to Jae-i?

397
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,292
I met with her father.

398
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,044
I thought…

399
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,130
I thought you wanted her to disappear,

400
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,382
so I asked him to send her to New York.

401
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,633
I said if he didn't,

402
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,720
I would tell everyone her secret.

403
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,181
What secret are you talking about?

404
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,391
That she was pregnant.

405
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:22,351
What?

406
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,520
With Ri-an's child.

407
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,275
Oh my God, how can you be such a jerk!

408
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,820
How could you tell that to Jae-i's father?
How could you do that, huh?

409
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,406
-How could you do something like that?
-It was you!

410
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,284
You made it clear I had to choose sides.

411
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,536
I chose you. Don't you get that?

412
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:49,462
Fine, but I still don't understand
how you could do something like that.

413
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,714
How are you ever going to face Ri-an now?

414
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,925
How will you be able
to look Jae-i in the eye?

415
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,969
You know how important
you are to them, you idiot!

416
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,347
I'll come clean, then.

417
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,767
I should tell them it was my fault.
That it was my doing.

418
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,684
No, are you crazy?

419
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,355
You have to keep your mouth shut
if we want them to keep being our friends.

420
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,756
I wanted to say goodbye before I go.

421
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,843
I just handed over my resignation.

422
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,685
Nothing bad'll happen.

423
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,104
And no one will know.

424
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,022
But how can you really know that?

425
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,108
You and I,

426
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,318
we know everything.

427
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,738
There's no way this is over.

428
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,878
Wait.

429
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,297
But what the hell did she mean by that?

430
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,340
Did she do that to me on purpose?

431
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,835
Do you remember
when you asked me who I wanted?

432
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,256
You mean
between the Hermès and He-ra?

433
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:00,843
It's He-ra.

434
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,262
The one that I really wanna be with.

435
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,350
I know.

436
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,812
You came here at this hour
just to tell me that?

437
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,695
I did something horrible.

438
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,448
And I think all of this started

439
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,660
on my birthday.

440
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,787
All my wrongdoings.

441
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,499
And I'm scared to own them.

442
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,960
But there's one I have to tell you.

443
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,254
Lee Woo-jin.

444
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,173
What are you about to say?

445
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,800
That day, I didn't know

446
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,344
what really happened.

447
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,555
I didn't tell anyone…

448
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,185
that she was the one driving the car.

449
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,480
My dad's a politician.
I didn't wanna hurt him.

450
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,149
So I had it covered up.

451
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,486
Then one day,

452
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,863
I found a small pen in the car.

453
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,702
I didn't know till recently

454
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,745
that it was a camera.

455
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,764
I'm sorry, Jae-i.

456
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,404
This belongs

457
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:45,948
to In-han.

458
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:10,556
So you're saying the woman
in the video is a teacher at your school?

459
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,270
Yeah, start by finding out
the suspect's address, Detective.

460
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,440
What was that about the car registration?
It belonged to an assemblyman?

461
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,859
Presidential candidate Lee Han-jong.

462
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,866
What would a presidential candidate have
to do with a hit-and-run on a student?

463
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,786
I definitely think
we should report this to the chief.

464
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,162
Yeah, I think so too.

465
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,378
I'm Assistant Inspector Jung Ju-han.
You need to come with us.

466
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,796
Hold on a minute.

467
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,174
We have a search and seizure warrant.

468
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:46,884
Please cooperate.

469
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,971
Who gave you the permission to do this?
This is Jooshin High!

470
00:39:59,105 --> 00:39:59,939
Damn it.

471
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,819
Ms. Han Ji-su? I'm Inspector Jang In-ho,
Seoul Yongo Police.

472
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,780
You're under arrest for hit-and-run
according to Article 5,

473
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:11,492
Paragraph 3 of the Act of
Aggravated Punishment for Specific Crimes.

474
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:16,038
You have the right to remain silent.
You can refuse to give a statement.

475
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,967
Hi. Ms. Han?

476
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,301
Thank you for last time.

477
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,303
Thank you.

478
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,681
Are things better for you yet?

479
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,474
Yes.

480
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,685
You're a very skilled artist, In-han.

481
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:38,936
Keep up the good work.

482
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,521
See ya!

483
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,648
Appreciate it.

484
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:08,215
The former chairman's purpose
for establishing a private institution

485
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,260
was to nurture students
to become assets to their country.

486
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:14,930
But instead, we have a place that enabled
drugs and bullying to become rampant.

487
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,932
And a Jooshin teacher
was behind the hit-and-run

488
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,601
that resulted in the death of a student.

489
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,228
I'll take responsibility.

490
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:25,191
The losses suffered can't be replaced
by taking responsibility.

491
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,485
We will discuss how this shall be handled

492
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,946
with the new principal of Jooshin.

493
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,827
Chairwoman An! Chairwoman An!

494
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,043
I hope you're aware
of how hard I have worked

495
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,087
to protect the school's reputation
over the years.

496
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,297
I don't understand.

497
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,300
How could you treat me like garbage
and just throw me away?

498
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,511
Considering everything you've done,

499
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,263
I think "garbage"
is being a little too kind.

500
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,767
Do you think I actually bother
to be involved in the school

501
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,644
because I care about some institution?

502
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,562
No.

503
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,191
I'm doing it all for Ri-an.

504
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,070
You should've done everything
in your power to protect my son.

505
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,488
That was your one duty.

506
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,115
Protecting the successor of Jooshin.

507
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,598
I'm glad you're leaving the school, Mom.

508
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,104
I no longer have to be
ashamed of your actions.

509
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:53,404
I gave Kang Ha all those videos
that he showed the police.

510
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,240
I've known for a while
that Jooshin told you

511
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:59,368
to keep an eye on
the student's personal cloud, so…

512
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,247
So I wanted to use it
to destroy this place.

513
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:09,044
But I couldn't 'cause I didn't want it
to blow back on you.

514
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,511
-Ju-won.
-But it's all over now.

515
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,599
And I'm happy you no longer have
to play a part in that.

516
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:27,980
That's all I ever wanted.

517
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,276
Is it true there were drug deals…

518
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,487
Can you elaborate
on the eldest daughter's pregnancy?

519
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,113
It's come as a huge shock

520
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,532
that the eldest daughter of
the "A" Group family was pregnant

521
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,909
and has since had a miscarriage.

522
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:25,412
Even more shocking is that the father
is the heir to the "B" Group fortune.

523
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,499
Yes, and the relationship
between the A and B Groups…

524
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,877
I want this handled.

525
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:37,007
Make sure the response
does no damage to Jooshin's reputation.

526
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,011
So how are you feeling?

527
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,974
I'm asking you how it feels
to live a life exactly like your mother's.

528
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,937
And no matter how repulsive I find it,

529
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,649
I have to acknowledge
that you take after her.

530
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,317
Your behavior makes that clear.

531
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:59,738
Your carelessness has destroyed
any plans I had in place for you.

532
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,118
You serve no purpose to me now.

533
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,500
I guess this was inevitable.

534
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:14,461
You and I
have just wasted our precious time.

535
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,258
I was scared…

536
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,679
that you'd throw me out
like you did to Mom.

537
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,808
Since I was three years old,
you always told me

538
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,602
that if I wasn't good,

539
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,522
you'd make me disappear too.

540
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,483
And I was so scared of that.

541
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,659
But I'm not now.

542
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,620
Not anymore.

543
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:51,874
Just be aware…

544
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,422
I don't see a point in ever going back
when I end something.

545
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,215
And that goes even more so

546
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,634
for people.

547
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,488
Let's go play some basketball.
Free throw bets.

548
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,948
What? I'm never holding us up.
Come on, let's go.

549
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,367
-Loser buys drinks, okay?
-Okay. Let's go.

550
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,077
Hey, let me join, let me join.

551
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,947
I wanna say I'm sorry.

552
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,667
I went to where In-han is.

553
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,753
You went to see my brother?

554
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,713
So, uh, just so you know,

555
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,883
while I didn't directly cause
what happened,

556
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,427
it is true the guys
were bullying him that day.

557
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,014
And it's all my fault.

558
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,978
I should've stepped in
and put a stop to it all.

559
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,818
At the time, I just couldn't stand
seeing him hang out with Jae-i.

560
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:44,862
So I just stood there

561
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,322
as they tormented him
and pushed him around.

562
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,619
Look, I know

563
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,497
I'll probably never be forgiven.

564
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,125
Even so…

565
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:02,838
I owe an apology

566
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,717
both to you and to…

567
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,219
and to In-han too.

568
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,347
I lost my brother, Ri-an.

569
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,644
You could apologize a million times,
and still, it won't bring him back.

570
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,523
You're sorry, are you?

571
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,156
Must be nice.

572
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,454
If it wasn't for that accident,

573
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:40,250
my brother would still be here,
laughing and joking with me.

574
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,253
If you guys didn't bully him,

575
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,548
if he wasn't driven
into the streets so late…

576
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,468
then he'd…

577
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,055
he'd still be alive and well.

578
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,353
You're sorry?

579
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,021
All right.

580
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,190
Just

581
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,193
take that guilt and learn to live with it.

582
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,947
Because I will never

583
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,658
accept your apology.

584
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,758
Everything is a result
of my negligence.

585
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,804
Before being the chairperson
and the leader of a group,

586
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:37,265
I am a mother,
and my child has caused trouble.

587
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,602
And for that, I apologize.

588
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,230
However, the illegal video
currently circulating

589
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,107
is a clear violation of the law.

590
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,026
We will take legal actions
to curtail its circulation.

591
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,153
Mr. Choi Yun-seok.

592
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,280
Do you admit
to inflicting acts of violence

593
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,949
on the scholarship students?

594
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,326
And lastly,

595
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:00,664
I fully acknowledge the magnitude
of the violence and inappropriate behavior

596
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:04,001
by the students
of Jooshin's private institution,

597
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:07,462
and I vow to ensure
all wrongs shall be righted.

598
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,506
Choi Yun-seok, Baek Chan-min,

599
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,633
Kwon Jae-jun, Cha Ji-seok, Lee Yu-jin.

600
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,677
Do you still deny your actions?

601
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,607
I am also

602
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:29,776
an offender.

603
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,916
Maybe I should've just come clean

604
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,960
about visiting Jae-i's father.

605
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,337
You already destroyed
your dad's presidential campaign

606
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,006
by handing over that spy pen.

607
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:57,429
And you know there are times
when some things are better left unsaid.

608
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,015
Like your betrayal of Jae-i.

609
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,975
We'll be taking that to the grave,
all right?

610
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,521
Just be sure to treat Jae-i and Ri-an well
till the day you die.

611
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,106
Wonder if it'll change.

612
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,566
What?

613
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,525
Jooshin.

614
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,069
Us four.

615
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:19,618
I mean, I just don't see…
any quick fix for things like that.

616
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,996
Whether that's us or Jooshin.

617
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:26,750
I'll see you later?

618
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,382
Don't go anywhere, and head straight home.

619
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,842
Yeah.

620
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,146
Our first time taking the bus together

621
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:50,857
as high schoolers.

622
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,322
We always took it together
in the middle school days.

623
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,701
I was scared.

624
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,872
And I'm sorry for avoiding you.

625
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,458
I should've been there for you.

626
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:09,918
What?

627
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,921
You've changed so much
since you've become rich.

628
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,382
When did we ever
apologize for stuff like that?

629
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,385
We would beat each other up
and just let it slide.

630
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,805
Don't you remember?
In-han would always go,

631
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,390
"That stuff happens between friends."

632
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,738
See now? Told you it'd look good on you.

633
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,032
Yeah, but that's a given.

634
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,159
I'm Yoon He-ra.

635
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,036
He-ra.

636
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:46,746
Mm-hmm?

637
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,709
I never knew
that you secretly felt that way.

638
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,254
I know that I can be direct
and a bit cold.

639
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:59,217
But I thought you knew
that's just how I communicate.

640
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,597
It was never because
I didn't consider you a friend.

641
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,518
I know that.

642
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,772
And I didn't act any better.

643
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,734
Kinda embarrassing, actually.

644
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,488
I feel like we've been best friends
for next to forever,

645
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,157
but I only just got it.

646
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:23,825
What?

647
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,412
You're not cold naturally,
but you just pretend like you are.

648
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,876
And it was just a way for you
to protect yourself.

649
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,178
I'll wait for you, okay?

650
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,187
Please hurry back.

651
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,277
My friend, Jung Jae-i.

652
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,157
Take care of yourself,

653
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,326
my mean…

654
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,788
and beautiful friend.

655
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,378
Let's go.

656
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,444
Could you pull over?

657
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,166
Skip school and spend the day with me.

658
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,343
-You have to hold on, okay?
-Okay.

659
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,846
-All right?
-I'll hold on. Now, let's ride.

660
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,682
-Ooh!
-So close.

661
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,475
-Are you good?
-Let me try again.

662
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,561
-I'm going.
-Let's go.

663
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,109
-Look at me. How am I doing?
-That's it. Try coming this way.

664
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,078
-Whoa!
-Easier than I thought it'd be!

665
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,916
-You're good at this. You are.
-I know, right?

666
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,087
What do you think? I'm good, aren't I?

667
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,592
Here. Try it.

668
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,763
Oh. This is… what?

669
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:51,473
Toast.

670
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,144
Just try it, all right?

671
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:59,272
Hold on. When did you try this before?

672
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,317
I actually haven't yet.

673
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,569
I wanted to try it with you.

674
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,537
Ooh, it's really good.

675
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,081
-Quick. Try it.
-Let's go.

676
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:23,171
How is it?

677
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,048
-Mmm. Really good.
-It's good, isn't it?

678
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,052
Does this chef have a Michelin star?
They should be famous!

679
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,347
-You're not hungry? I'm taking yours too!
-No! No way, I'm gonna eat it.

680
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,765
Let's get another one.

681
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,486
The weather is beautiful.

682
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,238
The breeze feels good too.

683
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,198
Yeah, real good.

684
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,242
Ri-an.

685
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:55,245
Kang Ha once said to me

686
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,581
that I should find and protect

687
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,543
whatever makes me happiest in life.

688
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,421
So I thought about it.

689
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,216
And it's you, Ri-an.

690
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,846
From the moment I first saw you
when we were children,

691
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,723
you have always been part of my world.

692
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,227
That's how I survived and still survive.

693
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,855
Even to the 18-year-old Jung Jae-i,

694
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:25,483
you are her one and only source of light.

695
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,158
You're mine as well.

696
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,370
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be here either. No way.

697
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,421
But, Ri-an,

698
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:49,466
I think it's probably time

699
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,594
to stop being so dependent.

700
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,599
I'm looking forward to us meeting again

701
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,977
when we no longer have
to lean on each other

702
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,813
but can share
in each other's happiness individually.

703
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,608
Then we can come back together.

704
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,029
Let's say goodbye with a smile

705
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,615
so that one day we can be together

706
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,493
and smile again.

707
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,759
Jae-i, I hope that…

708
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,639
you don't have such a hard time.

709
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:42,393
I only want you to be happy, Jae-i.

710
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,117
Me too.

711
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,121
I also hope that…

712
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:10,255
you always smile
and lead a beautiful life.

713
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,248
Moving forward in time,

714
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:31,502
we'll discover the poetic verses
of William Shakespeare

715
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,879
and delve into the…

716
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,465
When you substitute it for five,
it becomes minus two here.

717
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,133
-Do you follow me?
-Right.

718
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,678
Hey, this looks nice.
Did your mom buy this for you?

719
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,847
-Two, three. One, two.
-Hey, give me that.

720
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:47,310
I'll be graduating, so I won't be able
to take care of you like I have been.

721
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,145
You'll take care of everyone now.

722
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,773
Did you get me a gift for graduation?
I'm just…

723
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,858
Get off your damn phone!
A senior's talking!

724
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,318
Ugh, jeez.

725
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,028
Hey!

726
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:31,729
Jae-i said, "Say sorry."

727
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,065
Um, is it for--

728
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:35,441
I mean, who else is here?

729
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,863
This isn't like you, He-ra.

730
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:45,702
I was wondering
who'd eat this kinda thing.

731
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,620
I heard you introduced her to it.

732
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,540
Well,

733
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:54,210
she didn't actually eat it,
so she wouldn't know if it was good.

734
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,340
Too sweet.

735
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,466
Whoa!

736
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,509
Who is this for?

737
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:02,885
Ugh.

738
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,111
I didn't know
it would turn out this way.

739
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,989
I tried so many times to stop
and forget everything.

740
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:07,992
I just…

741
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,578
I just wanted…

742
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,872
I just wanted to be with you.

743
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,042
But I couldn't.

744
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:17,919
I wasn't able.

745
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,798
I couldn't let
another tragedy happen again.

746
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,091
It's why I was here.

747
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:27,345
Kang Ha.

748
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:29,096
So I had no other options.

749
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,309
I didn't know it would force you to go.

750
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:36,521
Sorry.

751
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,025
I'm sorry for making you leave.

752
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,445
I'm sorry for having a crush on you

753
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,531
and for everything.

754
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:58,084
You said you wanted to see me smile.

755
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,712
You won't be able to see it
through those tears.

756
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,679
Don't worry too much.

757
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:12,640
I'm not going.

758
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:14,809
You're not?

759
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:19,730
I'm gonna stand on my own
and follow my heart.

760
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:26,112
I'm going to a new place to start over
where I'll be happy.

761
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,159
So, Kang Ha…

762
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,205
don't worry about me at all

763
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,000
and take care.

764
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:51,679
Oh yeah.

765
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:53,931
That day.

766
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,435
Do you remember
the last question you asked?

767
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,614
You were right about it.

768
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,157
I was lying to you.

769
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:40,389
Hi, Mom.

770
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:51,658
YOU LOOK SHAKEN UP, KIM RI-AN
